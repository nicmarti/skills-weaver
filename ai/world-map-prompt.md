### VERSION DETAILLEE (pour briefing artiste ou prompt enrichi)

```
A highly detailed fantasy world map in the style of classic hand-drawn RPG cartography (similar to official D&D campaign setting maps, Inkarnate or Wonderdraft professional output). Top-down view on aged parchment background with an ornate decorative border featuring subtle heraldic motifs from the four kingdoms.

=== TWO-CONTINENT LAYOUT ===

The world features TWO CONTINENTS connected by a wide land bridge (isthmus of ~80km), creating a strategically vital chokepoint. The map is oriented landscape (wider than tall).

WESTERN CONTINENT ("Vieux Continent"): Larger, more varied. Runs north-south. Contains three kingdoms: Karvath dominates the massive northern half (mountains, forests), Valdorine holds the central-west coast (ports, islands), and tiny Asterne clings to the southern peninsula (fading grandeur).

EASTERN CONTINENT ("Continent de Lumiere"): Broad and flat. Dominated almost entirely by the vast Theocratie de Lumenciel, spreading across enormous golden plains. The Terres Brulees desert lies at the far southern edge.

The LAND BRIDGE connecting the two continents runs east-west between Karvath's eastern foothills and Lumenciel's western frontier. This is the most militarized zone on the map: the 80-year war border.

A large inland sea or wide strait separates the southern portions of the continents, with Asterne's coast facing Lumenciel's southern shores across the water. This is the "Mer Interieure" - key for maritime trade.


=== THE FOUR KINGDOMS (color-coded regions) ===

Each kingdom has a subtle color wash over its territory:

--- WESTERN CONTINENT ---

**1. EMPIRE DE KARVATH (Northern Half of West Continent) - Red/Dark Red wash with steel gray accents**
SIZE: Very large. The entire northern half of the western continent - about 40% of all visible land.
Territory: From the northern frozen coasts down to the central mountain spine. Massive, imposing, sparsely populated for its size.
Terrain: Towering snow-capped mountain range "Montagnes de Fer" running east-west like a spine, thick dark conifer forests (Foret de Grimmwald) covering the foothills, deep valleys with rushing torrents, high windswept plateaus, military roads drawn as straight lines connecting fortified positions. A few frozen lakes in the far north. The eastern edge descends into forested hills toward the land bridge.
Heraldic symbol (small, near the region name): Iron eagle on blood-red field.

Capital: FER-DE-LANCE (fortress city icon, 100,000 hab.) - Impregnable fortress city nestled in a deep mountain valley, drawn with massive walls, towers, and barracks. Located in the heart of the Montagnes de Fer.
Cities:
- FORGE-NOIRE (city icon, 70,000 hab.) - Industrial city at the base of mountains, visible smoke plumes from foundries, river of molten slag
- KERMK (fort icon, 60,000 hab.) - Northern frontier fortress, training grounds, surrounded by dark forest
- PORTE-DE-FER (fort icon, 60,000 hab.) - Eastern fortress guarding the land bridge approach. THE most fortified position on the map. Massive walls, towers, siege equipment drawn.

Sub-region labels:
- "Montagnes de Fer" in bold across the central mountain range
- "Foret de Grimmwald" for the vast northern dark forests
- "Hauts Plateaux" for the windswept northern plateaus
- "Marches de l'Est" for the eastern hills leading to the land bridge
- "Defiles Fortifies" near the mountain passes

Points of interest:
- Mines Naines du Pic d'Acier (pickaxe icon, deep in the mountains)
- Route Militaire Imperiale (straight road connecting Fer-de-Lance to Porte-de-Fer to Forge-Noire)
- Col du Sang (mountain pass with battle icon - historic battle site)
- Tours de Guet du Nord (watchtower icons along northern coast)


**2. ROYAUME DE VALDORINE (Central-West Coast) - Blue/Teal wash with gold accents**
SIZE: Medium. A coastal strip running along the western coast of the continent, wider at Cordova, narrowing north and south, 20% of the map. Includes a chain of offshore islands.
Territory: The entire western coastline from where Karvath's mountains meet the sea (north) down to the border with Asterne (south). Extends inland to the foothills but not into the mountains. The Iles Valdines archipelago lies offshore.
Terrain: Lush green coastal plains, rolling hills with vineyards, scattered deciduous forests, busy harbors with ships at anchor, lighthouses on rocky headlands, river deltas, fertile farmland in river valleys. The coast is deeply indented with natural harbors and bays.
Heraldic symbol: Gold ship on navy blue field.

Capital: CORDOVA (large city icon, 150,000 hab.) - Sprawling port city at the center of the coast, built around a magnificent natural harbor. Dozens of ships drawn at anchor. The largest city on the map - draw it bigger than all others.
Cities:
- PORT-DE-LUNE (city icon, 80,000 hab.) - Northern port, large shipyards with ships under construction, war galleys
- HAVRE-D'ARGENT (city icon, 50,000 hab.) - Southern banking city, elegant stone buildings, river mouth

Sub-region labels:
- "Cote Occidentale" along the main coastline
- "Collines de l'Ombre" for the hilly interior (village PIERREBRUNE marked with small dot)
- "Iles Valdines" for the offshore island chain (3-5 islands of various sizes)
- "Baie de Cordova" for the great natural harbor
- "Detroit Noir" for the dangerous northern strait between islands and mainland (skull icon - pirates)

Points of interest:
- Crypte des Ombres (dungeon icon near Pierrebrune in the hills)
- Ruines de Sombregarde (ruins icon on a hilltop)
- Chantiers Navals (anchor icon at Port-de-Lune)
- Phare d'Or (lighthouse icon on a headland)


**3. ROYAUME D'ASTERNE (Small Southern Peninsula) - Purple/Violet wash with faded silver accents**
SIZE: Medium. The smallest kingdom by far - a declining southern peninsula of the western continent, plus a stretch of coast. About 15% of the western continent. Visually obviously smaller than the others.
Territory: The southern tip of the western continent, forming a peninsula jutting south/southeast toward the Mer Interieure. Once controlled more territory, now shrunk.
Terrain: Faded autumn colors dominate - ochre, brown, muted orange. Dried farmland with abandoned estates, crumbling manor houses, overgrown ruins of former grandeur, thinning forests with bare branches, exhausted mines (crossed-out pickaxe icons). A melancholic, faded landscape. Some coastal cliffs.
Heraldic symbol: Wilting laurel crown on purple field.

Capital: ETOILE-D'AUTOMNE (faded palace city icon, 90,000 hab.) - Ancient imperial city with a crumbling but still grand palace complex, a university tower standing proud amid decay. Draw it with past grandeur visible but crumbling.
Cities:
- VALOMBRE (ghost town icon, 30,000 hab.) - Half-abandoned mining town, pit shafts visible, desolate
- PORT-DES-SOUVENIRS (small decaying port icon, 25,000 hab.) - Faded port on the Mer Interieure, very few ships

Sub-region labels:
- "Terres du Crepuscule" across the main territory
- "Landes Declinantes" for the barren interior
- "Cote des Souvenirs" for the southern coastline
- "Peninsule d'Asterne" as geographic label

Points of interest:
- Universite d'Etoile-d'Automne (book/tower icon - famous, still active)
- Grande Bibliotheque Imperiale (scroll icon - treasure of knowledge)
- Mines Epuisees (crossed pickaxes, abandoned)
- Palais Imperial en Ruine (ruin icon - former grandeur)


--- LAND BRIDGE (L'ISTHME DE FER) ---

**The strategic connection between the two continents.**
WIDTH: ~80 km, length ~150 km. Hilly terrain, sparse scrubland, heavily fortified on both sides.
EAST SIDE: Lumenciel's frontier forts and pilgrim outposts
WEST SIDE: Karvath's fortress PORTE-DE-FER and watchtowers

Label: "Isthme de Fer" 
Draw a HEAVY dashed border line with crossed swords icons along the middle - this is the 80-year war frontier.
Small fort icons on both sides facing each other.

--- EASTERN CONTINENT ---

**4. THEOCRATIE DE LUMENCIEL (Vast Eastern Continent) - White/Cream wash with golden sun accents**
SIZE: Big. Lumenciel occupies majority of the entire eastern continent - vast, spread out, seemingly endless golden plains. This is the largest kingdom by territory (even if not by population). The sheer scale should be visible on the map.
Territory: From the land bridge in the west to the eastern coast, from temperate north to the edge of the Terres Brulees in the south. Rolling fertile plains, sacred forests, river valleys.
Terrain: Golden wheat fields stretching to the horizon, gentle rolling hills, scattered sacred groves (drawn with slightly glowing/golden tree icons), grand cathedral spires visible from great distance, well-maintained pilgrim roads converging on Aurore-Sainte like a web. Rivers winding through farmland. Gentle, pastoral, beautiful - but with an undertone of oppressive order (perfectly straight roads, uniform fields).
Heraldic symbol: Radiating golden sun on white field.

Capital: AURORE-SAINTE (cathedral city icon, 120,000 hab.) - A magnificent city dominated by the Grande Cathedrale du Soleil Eternel with towering golden spires. Draw it centrally in the eastern continent. Multiple pilgrim roads radiate outward from it like sun rays.
Cities:
- REFUGE-DES-PURS (fortress-monastery icon, 40,000 hab.) - Walled religious fortress in western Lumenciel, near the land bridge. Inquisition headquarters. Menacing despite its holy name.
- VALLON-DE-PRIERE (town icon, 35,000 hab.) - Peaceful monastic valley city, seminaries, southern Lumenciel
- HAVEN-SOLAIRE (town icon) - Eastern coastal town, missionary port for overseas expeditions
- PORTE-SAINTE (fort icon) - Western frontier fort facing the land bridge

Sub-region labels (spread these across the vast territory to fill space):
- "Terres Saintes" in large text across the center
- "Plaines de la Foi" for the central golden farmlands
- "Forets Sacrees" for sacred woodland areas
- "Marches de l'Ouest" for the militarized western frontier near the land bridge
- "Cote de l'Aurore" for the eastern coastline
- "Champs Eternels" for the northern plains

Points of interest:
- Grande Cathedrale du Soleil Eternel (large cathedral icon at Aurore-Sainte)
- Chemins de Pelerinage (multiple dotted paths radiating from Aurore-Sainte like a spiderweb)
- Monastere de la Verite Cachee (hidden monastery icon, remote location)
- Reseau de Missionnaires (small sun icons at borders showing missionary outposts)


=== UNCONTROLLED TERRITORY ===

**TERRES BRULEES (Far South of Eastern Continent) - Desert tan/orange, no kingdom wash**
Territory: Southern edge of the eastern continent, beyond Lumenciel's effective control. A harsh desert.
Terrain: Sand dunes, cracked earth, scattered oases with palm trees, mysterious pre-human ruins half-buried in sand, bleached bones, heat shimmer. Transition zone from scrubland to full desert.

- SHASSETH (ancient ruins icon, large) - Massive pre-human city ruins in deep desert, half-buried, mysterious glyphs. Draw prominently - it's a major adventure destination.
- Oasis du Marchand (small oasis with a trading post icon)
- Caravansérail des Sables (waystation icon)
- "Terres Brulees" label in weathered, cracked script


=== WATER FEATURES ===

**Seas and Oceans** (labeled in elegant italic calligraphy, text follows the water):

- "Ocean des Tempetes" - Vast western ocean beyond the Iles Valdines. Dark, stormy waters with wave patterns drawn.
- "Mer Interieure" - The large body of water BETWEEN the two continents' southern portions. Separates Asterne (west) from southern Lumenciel (east). Calmer than the ocean. Critical for maritime trade. Draw this prominently - it's where Valdorine's navy dominates.
- "Detroit Noir" - Dangerous narrow strait between the Iles Valdines and the northern coast (pirate territory - draw a small skull-and-crossbones)
- "Golfe d'Asterne" - Bay on the western side of the Mer Interieure, near Port-des-Souvenirs
- "Baie de Cordova" - The great natural harbor
- "Mer des Sables" - Shallow treacherous waters off the Terres Brulees coast
- "Mer du Levant" - Eastern ocean beyond Lumenciel's coast

**Rivers** (drawn as blue flowing lines with names in small italic):

Western Continent:
- "Fleuve Dorin" - Major river. Source in the Montagnes de Fer, flows southwest through Valdorine, empties into the sea at Cordova. The lifeblood of Valdorine.
- "Riviere d'Argent" - Flows south from hills through Havre-d'Argent to the sea. Clear, fast-flowing.
- "Torrent de Fer" - Mountain torrent cascading from Montagnes de Fer eastward
- "Riviere Sombre" - Slow, dark river flowing through Asterne past Etoile-d'Automne. Drawn thinner, murky - it's slowly drying up.

Eastern Continent:
- "Fleuve Luminaris" - Great sacred river of Lumenciel. Flows from northern highlands through the plains, past Aurore-Sainte, south toward the Mer Interieure. Wide, majestic.
- "Riviere Doree" - Tributary flowing through the Plaines de la Foi, golden-tinted waters
- "Fleuve des Pelerins" - Eastern river, pilgrim boats travel on it

**Lakes**:
- "Lac du Miroir" - Large lake on the western continent, between Valdorine and Karvath territory. Reflects mountains beautifully - draw it with mountain reflections.
- "Lacs Jumeaux" - Twin mountain lakes high in the Montagnes de Fer, crystal blue
- "Lac Sacre" - Sacred lake in Lumenciel, near Vallon-de-Priere. Pilgrimage site, small temple island in center.
- "Lac des Larmes" - Shrinking lake in Asterne. Draw it with visible dried shorelines - the water has receded.
- "Lac de l'Isthme" - Small lake on the land bridge, contested water source


=== TRADE ROUTES ===

Drawn as dotted/dashed lines with small icons:

- "Route Maritime Principale" - Sea route through the Mer Interieure connecting Cordova to eastern ports. Ships drawn. THE most important trade route.
- "Route Maritime du Nord" - Sea route from Cordova north through the Detroit Noir. Label: "contrebande". Dangerous.
- "Route Terrestre des Armees" - Land route from Valdorine through Karvath (Fer-de-Lance) to the land bridge. Military road. Caravan icons.
- "Route Maritime des Epices" - Long sea route from Cordova south along the coast, around Asterne, to the Terres Brulees (Shasseth). Very long, dangerous.
- "Chemins de Pelerinage" - Multiple pilgrim paths converging on Aurore-Sainte from all directions (radiating pattern).
- "Route de la Soie Sacree" - Trade route from Aurore-Sainte to the Mer Interieure coast, then by ship to Cordova.


=== BORDERS ===

- Valdorine-Karvath border: Simple dashed line along the mountain foothills (neutral-tense, natural barrier)
- Valdorine-Asterne border: Light dashed line, barely visible (open border, economic dependency)
- Karvath-Lumenciel border (ON THE LAND BRIDGE): HEAVY dashed line with crossed swords icons, small fort symbols on both sides. Label: "Frontiere Contestee - 80 ans de guerre". THE most important border on the map.
- Lumenciel-Terres Brulees: Fading dashed line (Lumenciel's influence just... stops)

4. **Valdorine** est une bande cotiere a l'ouest, position centrale, controle le commerce maritime
5. **Asterne est minuscule** - une petite peninsule au sud-ouest, visiblement plus petit que tous les autres
6. **Lumenciel est vaste** - enormes plaines sur tout le continent est, impression d'espace infini
7. **La Mer Interieure** est le coeur du commerce maritime - Valdorine la domine
