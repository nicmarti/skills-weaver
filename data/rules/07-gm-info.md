TREASURE BASIC FANTASY RPG
Doom:  When this device is played (as appropriate for  
its form), this device will create animated skeletons or  
zombies as if by the spell animate dead.  Up to 3d6 hit 
dice  of  undead  monsters  will  be  so  created  from 
remains  within  a  60'  radius  of  the  character  who 
activated the device.  If both skeletal and fleshy remains  
are  available  in  the  area  of  effect,  skeletons  will  be 
animated in preference over zombies.  If the user is a  
magic-user  or  cleric,  the  created  undead  may  be  
controlled so long as that character retains the device.  
If played by a fighter or thief, the undead created will  
be  uncontrolled,  and  will  attack  any  living  creatures 
nearby.  The device may be used once per day, but no  
more than 18 hit dice of undead created by it may exist  
at any one time.
Fire Resistance:   The wearer of this device receives  
protection as the spell  resist fire , but  the protection  
works continually.
Invisibility:  The  wearer  of  this device  can  become 
invisible (as the spell invisibility) on command.  If the  
invisibility is dispelled (as described for the spell), the  
device may not be reactivated for one full turn.  The  
invisibility effect otherwise lasts for 24 hours.
Levitation:  The wearer of this device may levitate (as 
the spell) at will by concentrating.  There is no limit to  
how long this device may be used.
Mind Reading:  Whoever wears this device has access  
to a permanent form of the spell  mind reading ; it is  
always available  but  only  activates when the  wearer 
spends a full round concentrating upon it, and persists  
until the wearer ceases to use it.  The effect can be  
activated as many times per day as the wearer wants.
Panic:  When this device is played (as appropriate for  
its form), all creatures more than 20 feet from the user  
but not over 120 feet away must save vs. Spells or be  
affected as by the spell cause fear.
Penetrating Vision:   On command, and for so long  
thereafter that the wearer concentrates on it, this device  
confers the power to see through solid matter as if it  
were transparent as glass.  The effect extends at most  
20 feet, and the wearer sees as if in normal light even if  
they are in fact in total darkness.
This effect is blocked by certain materials; the wearer  
can see through at most 3 feet of wood or soil, 1 foot of 
stone, or 1 inch of most metals.  Gold or lead no thicker 
than foil will completely block the effect.
The device may be used three times per day, and each  
use lasts at most one turn.
Protection:  The wearer of an item with this power  
receives  the  listed  benefit  (from  +1  to  +3)  to  their 
Armor Class for so long as the ring is worn.  This bonus 
is also applied to the wearer's saving throw die rolls.
Protection from Energy Drain:   This device  has the  
power to absorb and neutralize energy-draining attacks,  
death spells or effects (such as slay living), and curses  
that would otherwise affect the wearer.  The device has  
2d6  charges  when  found,  and  each  negative  level, 
curse, or spell absorbed consumes one charge .  When  
the device's charges are exhausted it disintegrates into  
golden sparkles and disappears.
Protection from Scrying:   The wearer of this item is  
immune to all forms of scrying (including crystal balls,  
clairvoyance,  clairaudience,  and any  other means  of 
location or spying at a distance) as well as any form of  
mind reading.  Other characters who are within 30' of  
the wearer are also immune to scrying, but not to mind 
reading.
Regeneration:  This  device  grants  the  wearer  the  
power  of  regeneration,  exactly  as  described  in  the 
description  of  the  Troll  on  page  152,  including  the 
weakness with respect to acid and fire damage.  Note  
that this device will only heal damage suffered while it is 
worn; pre-existing damage is not healed by putting on  
the device.
Scrying:  This device can be used to spy upon other  
people or locations, regardless of distance.  A scrying  
device  may only be used by Magic-Users.  It can be  
used three times per day, for up to a turn each time.
The chance of success when using a scrying device is as 
shown below.  Total chances equal to or greater than  
100% do not require a roll.
Knowledge and Connection Chance
Secondhand Knowledge (heard of) 25%
Firsthand Knowledge (seen briefly) 55%
Familiar (known well) 95%
Possession or garment +25%
Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc. +50%
The user of the device is the only one who will see the  
image.   No  sound  will  be  heard  normally.   Detect 
magic,  detect  evil,  and  mind  reading have  a  3% 
chance per level of the caster of operating correctly if  
used with a scrying device.
Scrying,  Superior:  This  item  works  exactly  like  a 
standard scrying device, as described above, but also  
allows  the  user  to  hear  any  sounds  in  the  location 
viewed as if they were there.

BASIC FANTASY RPG TREASURE
Speed:  The wearer of this device can activate it with a  
command word (or by clicking their heels together, if  
the item takes the form of boots) and gain the effect of  
a  haste spell, and can end the effect the same way.  
The effect can be used for a total of 10 rounds each  
day.
Spell Storing:  These much sought-after devices each  
contain a number of spells which can be cast by the  
wearer.  Most of them contain Magic-User spells, but 1  
in 10 contains Clerical spells instead.  No device may  
contain spells of both types!  Each spell stored in the  
device is cast as if by the lowest-level character who  
could normally cast the spell, but not less than 6 th level 
in any case.
Any class may wear and use this device, but it can only  
be recharged by casting the appropriate spell into it.  A  
table is provided below to determine how many spells,  
and what levels they are.  A spell storing device must be 
recharged with the same spells that were placed into it  
when it was made; so a Pendant of Two Spell Storing 
containing fireball and fly can only be recharged with  
those two spells.  
The wearer of one of these devices automatically knows 
the  names  of  the  spells  stored  within  it,  but  is  not 
granted detailed knowledge of how each spell works.  If  
the wearer is not a magic-user and no such character is  
available  to  advise  the  wearer,  there  may  be  some 
difficulty in using it successfully (and safely).
A device of this type found in a treasure hoard may be  
completely charged, or discharged, or partially charged,  
at the GM's option.

Spell Turning:  This device reflects spells cast directly  
at the wearer, but not area effect spells, back at the  
caster; so a  hold person spell would be reflected, but  
not a fireball.  It will reflect up to 2d6 spells before its  
power is exhausted.
Stealth:  The wearer of this device can move quietly in  
virtually any surroundings, granting a 90% chance of  
success when moving silently (as the Thief ability of the  
same name).
Telekinesis:  The wearer of this device can use the  
power of the spell telekinesis, as if cast by a 12 th level 
Magic-User.  The effect may be used as many times per  
day as the wearer wishes, but lasts only as long as the  
wearer concentrates on it.
Telepathy:  Three  times  per  day  this  item  can  be 
activated by use of its command word, at which point it  
will grant the wearer the power of a special version of  
the  mind reading  spell which has a range of 90 feet  
and lasts for 1 turn.  During this time the wearer can  
send  thoughts  to  the  mind  of  any  creature  whose 
thoughts  the  wearer  is  already  reading,  allowing  
communication.
Teleportation:  Upon command the wearer of this item 
may cast the spell teleportation as if by a wizard of the  
12th level of ability.  This power can be used up to 3  
times per day.
True Seeing:  Three times per day this device can grant 
the user the power of the spell true seeing.  Each use  
lasts at most one turn.
Water Walking:  This device allows the wearer to walk  
on any liquid as if it were firm ground.  Mud, oil, snow,  
quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can be  
traversed easily, since the wearer’s feet hover an inch or 
two above the surface.  Molten lava will still cause the  
wearer damage from the heat since they are still near it.  
The wearer can walk, run, or otherwise move across  
the surface as if it were normal ground.
Weakness:  Whoever puts  this device  on  is cursed;  
their Strength score is reduced immediately to 3.  The  
device can only be removed with remove curse.
Wishes:  This  device  contains  the  power  to  grant  
wishes to the wearer.  1d4 wishes will remain within the  
ring when it  is found.   The  GM  must  adjudicate  all 
wishes, and instructions are given in the Game Master 
section regarding this.
Rare Items
Bag of Devouring:  This device appears, to all tests, to  
be a normal  Bag of Holding , and in fact it performs  
exactly  like  one  at  first.   However,  all  items  placed 
within disappear forever 1d6+6 turns later.  The bag  
continues to weigh whatever it did after the items were  
placed within it (that is, one-tenth the total weight of the 
items), until it is opened and discovered to be empty.
Bag of Holding:  This device is a bag which appears to  
be about 2 feet wide and 4 feet deep.  It opens into an  
extradimensional space, and is able to hold more than  
should be possible: up to 500 pounds of weight, and up 
to 70 cubic feet of volume.  The bag weighs one-tenth  
177

## Page 182

TREASURE BASIC FANTASY RPG
as much as the total of the objects held within.  Any  
object  to be  stored  in  the  bag  must  fit  through  the 
opening, which has a circumference of 4 feet.
Puncturing or tearing the bag will destroy its magic and  
cause all contents to be lost forever.  If this item is  
turned inside out all contents are dumped.  The bag is  
unharmed, but it will no longer work until it is turned  
right side out again.  If living creatures are placed inside  
they will suffocate within a turn (with exceptions for  
creatures resistant to suffocation as determined by the  
GM).  The bag's volume cannot be overfilled (as excess  
items simply cannot be put inside), but if overloaded  
above 500 pounds and then lifted it will be torn.
Getting any particular item from the bag requires the  
bearer to spend a round  searching during  which no  
movement may be made.
Boots of Traveling and Leaping:   These boots allow  
the wearer to make great leaps, jumping up to 10' high  
and/or  30'  across.   They  improve  the  wearer's  
movement  so  greatly  that  they  also  increase  their 
movement rate on land by an additional 10' per round.
Broom of Flying:  This broom is able to fly through the 
air for up to 9 hours per day (split up as its owner  
desires).  The broom can carry 200 pounds and fly at a  
speed of 40 feet, or up to 400 pounds at a speed at 30  
feet. In addition, the broom  can travel alone to any  
destination named by the owner as long as they have a  
good idea of the location and layout of that destination.  
It comes to its owner from as far away as 300 yards  
when the command word is spoken.
Efreeti Bottle:   This item may appear as an ornate  
bottle,  or  sometimes  as  a  magic  lamp.   It  can  be 
activated once per day, by opening it if it takes the form 
of a bottle or by rubbing it if it takes the form of a lamp.  
When activated, smoke pours out and forms into an  
efreeti.
The  efreeti  released  was  trapped  in  the  bottle  and 
forced  to  serve  whoever  activates  it.   However,  an 
efreeti who has spent too long in a bottle may have lost  
its mind, and if this happens the efreeti will begin a  
frenzied  attack  upon  whoever  activated  the  bottle, 
disappearing when either the user of the bottle or the  
efreeti is dead.  There is, fortunately, only a 1 in 10  
chance this will happen.
On the other hand, there is also a 1 in 10 chance that  
the efreeti of the bottle is able to grant three wishes to 
the user.  If this is the case, the efreeti will perform no  
other service, and cannot return to the bottle after it is  
activated  until  the  user  makes  a  wish.   Subsequent 
wishes require additional activations, and upon the final  
wish being granted the efreeti disappears for good.
Roll 1d10 when the bottle is first activated; on a roll of  
1, the efreeti is insane, while on a roll of 0 the efreeti  
has three wishes to grant.  If neither of these results is  
rolled, the efreeti will serve the user for up to one hour  
per day for 101 days, after which time it is freed and  
will disappear.  Note that after the first activation, every  
day  that  passes  is  counted  toward  the  101  days 
whether or not the user activates the bottle.
Flying Carpet:  This item appears to be a fancy rug of  
the sort found in the castle of a king.  It has the power  
to fly, carrying those upon it as if they stand upon a  
solid surface.  A flying carpet is typically 5' x 8' in size  
and can carry up to 500 pounds at a movement rate of  
100' per round, or up to 1,000 pounds (its maximum  
capacity) at a rate of 50' per round.  A flying carpet can  
fly at any speed up to its maximum, and can hover on  
command.
Gauntlets of Ogre Power:   These thick leather gloves  
grant the wearer a Strength bonus of +4 (instead of  
their own  Strength  bonus).   Both gauntlets must be  
worn for the magic to be effective.
Girdle  of  Giant  Strength:  This  broad  leather  belt 
grants the wearer the strength of a giant.  For so long as  
it is worn, the wearer gains a Strength bonus of +5  
(instead of their own Strength bonus) , and can throw  
large stones just as a stone giant does.
Mirror of Imprisonment:  This item can appear as any  
style  of  full-length  or  larger  mirror.   It  is  a  form  of 
magical  trap,  which  can  be  set  or  deactivated  by 
speaking a command word followed by "activate" or  
"deactivate."
When in its active state, any character or creature who  
stands within 30 feet of the mirror and sees its reflection 
must save vs. Spells or be drawn bodily into the mirror,  
including all items worn or carried.  The victim is placed  
within one of 20 metaphysical cells inside the mirror.  
Those trapped in the mirror are mere reflections and  
are unable to take any action.  The last character who  
spoke the command word to the mirror is immune to its 
power, as are undead, constructs, and any creature that 
lacks eyes.
A character who speaks the command word and then  
calls the number of a cell will cause the reflection of the  
occupant  of  that  cell  to  appear  in  the  mirror.   The 
trapped creature can move and speak, but cannot cast  
spells or take any other real action.  The controlling  
character may interrogate the trapped victim if desired,  
though  the  mirror  does  not  compel  the  victim  to 
respond or to be truthful.  The controller may at any  
time speak the command word again and say "return"  
and  the  victim  will  be  returned  to  its  cell;  or,  the 
178

## Page 183

BASIC FANTASY RPG TREASURE
controller  can  say  the  command  word  followed  by 
"come out" to free the victim, who appears standing  
beside the controller.
Should all cells be full when a creature is drawn inside,  
one cell chosen at random  will be emptied with the  
freed creature appearing where the trapped one had  
been  standing.   The  freed  creature  is safe  from  the 
mirror for one turn thereafter before it can again be  
trapped.  All victims will be freed instantly if the mirror  
is broken.
Rope of Climbing:   This 50 foot long rope is about ½  
inch in diameter, but is capable of supporting up to  
3,000 pounds if tied to a secure anchor point.  When  
the user holds one  end of the rope and speaks the  
command  word,  the  rope  animates,  moving  like  a 
snake at a rate of 10' per round in whatever direction  
the user commands.  The rope is even able to move  
into a completely vertical position if so ordered.  It can  
be commanded to tie itself to any anchor point within  
reach (since the user must continue holding one end of  
the rope, it can reach no more than 50 feet from that  
point).  The rope has no real strength and thus cannot  
lift or support any weight if not tied to an anchor point.
Devices of Summoning Elementals
These  devices  all  grant  the  power  to  summon  and 
control an elemental.  As noted, the GM is likely to  
choose to allow only certain types of Elementals, so not  
all of these devices may be available in your campaign.
When one of these devices is activated  in accordance  
with the summoning rules described for the Elemental  
monster entry on page  88, an appropriate elemental  
appears and follows the summoner's commands.
Bowl of Summoning Water Elementals:   This device 
is about the size of a punch bowl, and will be made of  
precious metals set with jewels.  To activate this device,  
it must be filled with fresh water (at least a quart) and  
the command words inscribed around its rim must be  
spoken, which requires a full round to complete.
Brazier of Summoning Fire Elementals:   This device  
appears to be a small brazier, a metal bowl with legs  
and cage-like sides which stands about a 1½ feet tall.  
Braziers are meant to hold fire.  To activate this device,  
a fire must be built in this brazier and  the command  
words inscribed around its rim-band must be spoken,  
which requires a full round to complete.
Censer of Summoning Air Elementals:   This device  
appears to be an ornate but ordinary censer, a kind of  
bowl with a perforated lid and a chain which is used to  
lift and swing the device.  These are normally used in  
worship, but this device is made for a different purpose.  
To activate this device, incense must be placed in the  
bowl,  lit,  and  covered,  and  the  command  words  
inscribed around the edge of the lid must be spoken,  
which requires a full round to complete.
Crucible  of  Summoning  Metal  Elementals:  This  
device appears to be a small crucible, an open-topped  
vessel used for melting metal.  To activate this device, it  
must be  placed on a solid,  adequately  heat-resistant  
surface and the command words inscribed around the  
edge of the lid must be spoken, which requires a full  
round to complete.
The  crucible  becomes  very  hot  while  the  metal  
elemental is present, causing 2d8 points of damage to  
any character who dares to touch it barehanded and  
2d6 points even if wearing armor or ordinary fabric or  
leather gloves.  The crucible requires a full turn to cool  
after use.
Mallet of Summoning Wood Elementals:  This is a  
wooden mallet of the sort used by builders to drive in  
pegs; though it could be used as a weapon, it is a poor  
excuse for one as it does just 1d4 points of damage on  
a hit and is not treated as a magic weapon.  To activate  
this  device,  it  must  be  held  in  the  hand  and  the 
command words inscribed on one side of the hammer-
head must then be spoken, which requires a full round  
to complete.
Marble Plate of Summoning Cold Elementals:   This  
device is a circular plate of marble about 9 inches in  
diameter and about ¾ of an inch thick.  To activate this  
device, it must be placed level on a solid, stable surface  
and a full skin of fresh water must be poured upon it; as 
the water touches the base it magically freezes into a  
small  sculpture  of  a  cold  elemental.   The  command 
words inscribed around the rim of the plate must then  
be spoken, which requires a full round to complete.
Rod  of  Summoning  Lightning  Elementals:  This  
device appears as a copper rod about ¾ inch thick and  
2 feet long, tipped with a polished ball of amber.  The  
rod will have a smooth, polished green surface (a thin  
coating of verdigris) but will not be pitted or damaged  
by the corrosion.  To activate this device it must be held 
in the hand and the command words inscribed on the  
length of the rod must then be spoken, which requires a 
full round to complete.
Stone of Summoning Earth Elementals:   This device 
is a roughly-cut but highly-polished stone in which a  
vein or cluster of precious or semi-precious stones is  
visible.  To activate this device, it must be held in the  
user's hands and the command words inscribed on the  
smoothest area of the stone must be spoken, which  
requires a full round to complete.

PART 8:  GAME MASTER INFORMATION
Wandering Monsters
We had the foresight to bring several large sacks with us, and we swiftly filled them with coins and gems from  
beneath the sarcophagus.  Without further delay we moved out, intent upon reaching the stairs to the surface and  
then returning to Morgansfort.  But it couldn't be that easy…
On the way in, Barthal scouted ahead and we took our time, constantly on the lookout for monsters.  On the way  
out, we threw caution to the wind, moving at full speed with Barthal watching behind us.  So it was that  
Morningstar and I turned a corner and practically stepped on the first rank of a goblin patrol!
Once again I was caught flatfooted, but so were the goblins.  Morningstar reacted more swiftly, striking down the  
first of the little monsters.  You might think that parley would have been a better idea, but we had already tried  
that with these goblins without success… so I couldn't blame the Elf for striking first and asking questions later.
I raised the golden sword and waded into battle…
Dungeon Encounters
Besides "placed" monsters, dungeons usually contain wandering monsters.  The Game Master may create special  
wandering monster tables for specific dungeons, or the general wandering monster tables (below) may be used.
In an average dungeon, a wandering monster encounter will occur on a roll of 1 on 1d6; the Game Master should  
check once every 3 turns.  The circumstances of a specific dungeon may call for higher odds or more frequent (or  
possibly less frequent) wandering monster checks.

BASIC FANTASY RPG GAME MASTER INFORMATION
Wilderness Encounters
The Game Master should check for random encounters in the wilderness about every four hours of game time; this  
translates nicely to three night checks and three daytime checks.  If your players choose to stand three night  
watches, you simply check for each watch (or otherwise do whatever seems best to you); in the daytime, check  
morning, afternoon, and evening.
To check for a wilderness encounter, roll 1d6; on a roll of 1, an encounter occurs.  If a wilderness encounter is  
indicated, roll 2d8 on the appropriate table below.  The Game Master should think carefully about how the  
encounter happens; check for surprise in advance, and if the monster is not surprised, it may be considered to have 
had time to set up an ambush (at the GM's option).

City, Town or Village Encounters
It's important for the Game Master to remember that, unlike dungeon or wilderness environments, cities, towns and 
villages are busy places.  During the day, most towns will have people on the streets more or less all the time; the  
absence of people on the streets is often an indication of something interesting.  By night, much of the town will be  
dark and quiet, and encounters will be mostly Thieves or other unsavory types; but near popular eating or drinking  
establishments, people of all sorts are still likely to be encountered.  The GM must make sure that their descriptions  
of the town environment make this clear; of course, this will also make it harder for the players to identify "real"  
encounters.
The GM is encouraged to create their own encounter  
tables for use in each city, town or village created (or  
assign encounters by other means if desired); however,  
a set of "generic" encounter tables are provided below  
for those times when such preparation has not been  
completed.  Roll 2d6 on the table below to determine  
what sort of encounter occurs; a description of each  
type of encounter appears below the table.

BASIC FANTASY RPG GAME MASTER INFORMATION
Beggar encounters will often begin with a single beggar  
approaching the party, but there will generally be 2d4  
beggars in the area, and if any party member gives  
anything to the first beggar, the others will descend on  
the party like flies.  Each beggar is 90% likely to be a  
normal man, and 10% likely to be a 1 st level Thief,  
possibly scouting for the Thieves Guild or a local gang.
Bully encounters will be with 2d4 young toughs; each  
is 70% likely to be a normal man, 30% likely to be a 1 st 
level  Fighter.   Bullies  generally  appear  unarmed,  
depending  on  their  brawling  ability  in  a  fight  (but 
keeping a dagger or shortsword hidden, to be used in  
case the fight is going against them).  Bullies can be a  
bit unpredictable, such that the GM may want to use a  
reaction roll to determine the leader's mood.
City Watch encounters will be with 2d6 watchmen, all  
1st level Fighters save for the squad leader, who will be  
from  2nd through  4 th level.   They  will  confront  
"suspicious-looking" characters, but generally will need  
a  good  reason  before  they  attempt  to  arrest  or  
otherwise interfere with player characters.
Doppleganger encounters will, of course, appear to be  
some other type of encounter; the GM should roll again  
to determine what the doppleganger is masquerading  
as.  1d6 dopplegangers will be encountered; any extra  
group members will be humans who do not know they  
are traveling in the company of shapeshifting monsters.  
If the party is "interesting" to the dopplegangers, one or  
more of the monsters will attempt to follow them and  
replace a party member (as described in the monster  
description).  In many cases, player character parties  
will not discover the true nature of the encounter until  
much later.
Giant Rat encounters will generally involve alleys, the  
docks, or other "low" places.  Rats are generally not  
dangerous unless provoked, but if surprised they may  
attack.  See the monster description for details of this  
encounter type.
Lycanthrope, Wererat  encounters  will  appear to be  
some other type of encounter, either another sort of  
"normal" encounter or a giant rat encounter (depending 
on the circumstances).  Wererats are cowardly and will  
not attack a party of equal or larger size.
Mercenary encounters will involve 2d6 members of a  
mercenary  company,  going  about  some  business  or 
other.   A  mercenary  leader  may  offer a  position  to 
Fighter-classed  player  characters  if  they  have  any  
reputation at all.
Merchants are a common feature of towns, and may  
be encountered performing any sort of business.  As  
with mercenary encounters, merchants may offer jobs  
to interesting player characters, particularly those with  
good reputations.  See Creating an NPC Party, below, 
for details on this type of encounter.  (A merchant in a  
town may not have a full entourage as described below; 
the  GM  should  use  their  discretion  in  creating  the 
encounter.)
Nobles encountered may also offer positions to player  
characters,  or  possibly  offer  a  reward  for  some  
dangerous task.  Player characters with bad reputations  
may be confronted, ordered to leave town, or even  
arrested if the noble is able to call for the city watch.  
(See Creating an NPC Party, below, for details on this 
type of encounter.)  A noble in a town may not have a  
full entourage as described below; the GM should use  
their discretion in creating the encounter.
Press Gangs  will consist of 2d6 Fighters, all 1 st level  
except for one or two leaders of 2 nd through 5 th level. 
They will be armed with blunt weapons or possibly will  
fight with their bare hands, since their goal is to capture  
rather than kill player characters; however, it is likely  
that at least some members of a press gang will have  
daggers or swords on their persons in case a serious  
fight breaks out.  A press gang will not confront a party  
of equal or greater size unless the party is obviously  
weakened,  drunk,  etc.   If  the  party  loses,  they  will 
awaken  aboard  a ship at  sea  or in  a military  camp 
(depending  on  whether  sailors  or  soldiers  captured 
them), unarmed and at the mercy of their captors.
Priest encounters will usually be similar to a group of  
pilgrims  (see  Creating  an  NPC  Party,  below,  for 
details), though the group encountered will not be as  
large  as  would  be  encountered  in  the  wilderness. 
Generally, a single priest of 1 st through 4 th level will be  
encountered, accompanied by 1d4 of the faithful.
Shadow encounters in a town will be much like the  
same  encounter  underground;  see  the  monster  
description for details.
Thief encounters will be with a group of 1d6 Thieves, 
generally disguised as ordinary townsmen or sometimes  
as beggars.  One Thief in the group will be from 2 nd to 
4th level, with the others being 1 st level only.  They will  
seek to steal from the party, of course, unless watched  
very carefully.
Wizard encounters  will  involve  a  Magic-User  of  4th 
through 7th level, accompanied by 1d4-1 apprentices of  
1st level.  The GM must decide on the temperament  
and mood of the wizard.

GAME MASTER INFORMATION BASIC FANTASY RPG
Creating An NPC Party
Adventurers
A party of NPC adventurers 
will  usually  consist  of  4-8 
characters, as follows:  1d3  
Fighters,  1d2  Thieves,  1d2 
Clerics,  and  1d2-1  Magic-
Users.   Usually  the  
characters  will  all  be  of  
similar levels; after deciding  
what average level the party  
should be, you may wish to  
make  a  few  of  the  
characters  lower  levels  (to 
reflect  the  usual  
"replacements"  brought  in  
when some characters die).
The  Game  Master  must  
choose the race or races of  
the NPC adventurers to suit  
the  region  where  they  are 
found  (or  come  from).  
Probably  80%  or  more  of 
adventurers  are  Human,  
10%  are  Dwarves,  6%  are 
Halfling  and  the  remaining  4%  Elvish.   If  the  NPC 
adventurer party is evil, the GM may choose to replace  
some party members with humanoid monsters such as  
orcs, hobgoblins, or gnolls.
The  party  may  be  rivals  with  the  player  characters, 
vying for the same treasures, or they may actually be  
enemies, evil marauders that the player characters must  
defeat.   It  is,  of  course,  possible  that  the  NPC  
adventurers  are  allied  or  otherwise  friendly  with  the 
player characters, but this may make things too easy for 
the players.
Bandits, Brigands, and Highwaymen
A party of bandits will generally consist of 2d12 1 st level 
Fighters and 1d6 1 st level Thieves, led by a Fighter or  
Thief of 2nd to 5th level (1d4+1) or by one of each class  
(if there are 11 or more 1 st level members total).  In the  
wilderness, bandits will generally have horses or other  
steeds appropriate to the terrain (stolen, of course) as  
well  as light  armor,  swords and bows or crossbows.  
Determine magic items as given below for the leaders  
only;  rank-and-file  members  will  not  normally  have 
magic items.
In their lair or hideout, a party of bandits will generally  
have type A treasure (with magic items omitted since  
they will have been generated using the rules below).
Buccaneers and Pirates
The  difference  between  buccaneers  and  pirates  is 
largely  a  question  of  what  they  wish  to  be  called; 
whatever  you  call  them,  they  are  waterborne  
equivalents of bandits, attacking other ships or raiding  
coastal towns for plunder.
A buccaneer party will consist of 3d8 1 st level Fighters,  
led by a Fighter of 3 rd to 6 th level (1d4+2) and 1d3  
Fighters of 2 nd to 5 th level.  All will be experienced at  
handling ships, of course.  They will be unarmored or  
armored only in leather, and will be armed with swords  
and bows or crossbows.
Seagoing pirates may appear in larger numbers, but the  
number  of  leader-types  will  be  similar  to  that  given 
above.   Generate  magic  items  for  leaders  only  as 
described below.  A shipload of pirates or buccaneers  
will have a type A treasure, with magic items omitted  
(since magic items will already have been rolled for the  
NPCs);  the  treasure  may  not  be  aboard  the  ship, 
however, as pirates often bury their treasures on distant  
shores.  In such a case, the Captain or one of his mates  
will have a map of some kind leading to the treasure.
Merchants
Merchants  must  often  transport  their  wares  through 
wilderness areas.  About half of the time (50%), a land-
bound merchant party will be led by a single wealthy  
merchant; other merchant parties will consist of 1d4+1  
less wealthy merchants who have banded together for  
their own safety.  There will be 2d4 wagons (but at least 
one per merchant) drawn by horses or mules.  Each  
wagon is driven by a teamster who is a normal man,  
usually  unarmored  and  armed  with  a  dagger  or  
shortsword.  The caravan will employ 1d4+2 first-level  
Fighters and 1d4 second-level Fighters as guards.
If encountered at sea, a merchant party will generally  
consist of a single ship owned or rented by a single  
merchant.  The ship will have a crew of 2d8+8 regular  
crewmen, who are normal men, unarmored and armed  
with clubs, daggers or shortswords; the Captain, First  
Mate, and other officers are taken from this number.  
Large ships may require larger crews.  1d4+2 first-level  
Fighters and 1d4 second-level Fighters will be aboard  
as guards, just as with a caravan.
Besides  the  valuable  but  undoubtedly  bulky  trade 
goods transported by  the  merchant caravan or ship,  
such a party will also have a type A treasure, with magic 
items omitted; it may be in one chest, or spread out  
among the wagons.

BASIC FANTASY RPG GAME MASTER INFORMATION
Nobles
A  noble  party  will  consist  of  a  noble  (of  course), 
possibly accompanied by a spouse  (also a noble, of  
course) and/or one or more children.  Each adult noble  
will  have  at  least  one  attendant  (assistant,  lady-in-
waiting, etc.).
Lower-ranking  nobles  (such  as  barons)  will  have  a 
single wagon or carriage, drawn by fine horses; higher-
ranking nobles will have two or more wagons.  The  
noble may be mounted on a warhorse, though they  
may choose to ride in a carriage part of the time.  Each  
carriage or wagon will have a teamster, who in this case  
will be a 1st level Fighter in chainmail with a longsword.  
At least two mounted Fighters of 1 st through 4 th level  
will be with the noble as guards; again, higher ranking  
nobles will have more guards.  Guards will generally be  
armed with longswords and possibly lances, armored in  
platemail, and their warhorses will usually be barded  
with  chainmail.   Determining  the  exact  number  of 
guards  is  left  to  the  GM  in  this  case.   The  normal 
chances for magic items apply, of course.
A noble will usually be traveling with a little spending  
money; a type A treasure should be rolled to represent  
this.   In this case,  do  not  omit  the  magic  items,  as 
nobles will generally be more wealthy than the average  
party of men.
Nobles are usually (70%) normal men; otherwise, roll  
1d10:  1-6 indicates a Fighter, 7-8 indicates a Magic-
User, 9 indicates a Cleric, and 10 indicates a Thief.  
(Clerical  "nobles"  are  bishops,  archbishops,  and  the 
like.)  Roll 2d4-1 for the level of each "classed" noble.
Pilgrims
A party of pilgrims is on its way to (or from) a major  
religious locale or activity.  Such a party will be led by a  
1d4 Clerics of level 1-4 (roll for each).
The remainder of the party is rather random in nature;  
most  pilgrim  groups  include  3d6  normal  men  (or 
women  if  the  religion  allows  women  to  go  on  
pilgrimages), 1d6 Fighters of level 1-4 (roll for each)  
with chainmail and longsword, and 1d4 Thieves of level 
1-4 (each of whom may be a genuine devout person,  
or  possibly  just  on  the  lam).   There  is  also  a  50% 
chance of a single Magic-User of level 1-4 being with  
the party.
Pilgrims usually travel light, carrying a single bag each  
and walking or riding  mules or horses.  The pilgrim  
party will most likely be bringing offerings of some sort  
to their destination; generate a type A treasure for this  
purpose.  If magic items are indicated, they will most  
likely not be used by any of the NPCs as they have  
already been dedicated to the god or pantheon.
Magic Items for NPCs
NPCs will generally have magic items in proportion to  
their class and level; assume a 5% chance per level that  
any  given Fighter,  Thief,  or  Cleric  NPC  will  have  a 
magic weapon or magic armor (roll for weapon and  
armor separately for each NPC).  Regardless of level, a  
roll of 96-00 should be considered a failure.  Magic-
Users will have a Ring of Protection (roll the bonus as  
usual for the item) on a roll of 4% per level, and a  
magic dagger or walking staff on a roll of 3% per level.
In addition, assume a 2% per level chance that any  
given character will have a potion, and 3% per level  
that a Cleric or Magic-User will have a scroll of some  
sort.
Finally, add up the levels of all members of the party,  
and use this number as a percentage chance that a  
Rare Item (as found on the table on page 169) will be 
found  among  them.   If  the  roll  is made,  divide  the 
number  by  two  and  roll  again;  if  the  second  roll  is 
made, two such items are found.  If the party has more  
than 3 members, you might wish to divide the number  
in half again and roll for a third such item.  Assign the  
item or items to whichever party members seem most  
appropriate, or roll randomly if you can't decide.
Non-Human Parties
It is assumed above that NPC parties will be Human, or  
predominantly so; but the Game Master may choose to  
present  parties  of  Elves,  Dwarves,  or  Halflings  from 
time  to  time.   In  general,  such  a  party  will  be  
homogeneous; an Elf party would consist of all Elves,  
for instance.  If encountered in the territory of another  
race, the party might include a guide hired to lead them  
to  their  destination.   For  example,  the  Elf  party  
mentioned above might hire a Human guide to help  
them when traveling through a Human country.
The Game  Master may simply use the  figures given  
above when generating such parties.  One thing that the 
GM must decide is whether or not the "normal men"  
rules apply to non-humans… are there "normal elves"  
for instance?  This decision is left to the GM.  If there  
are  such  characters,  they  will  have  the  same  racial 
abilities as others of their kind, but will fight with an  
Attack Bonus of +0 just as normal men do.  If there are  
no such characters in the campaign world, then simply  
substitute 1 st level Fighters for the normal men listed  
above.

GAME MASTER INFORMATION BASIC FANTASY RPG
Dealing with Players
Character Creation Options
The standard character creation rules call for rolling 3d6 
for each Ability Score in order.  Players may complain  
that they can't create the sort of characters they want to  
play.  Here are several options you may choose from if  
you wish to make things easier for your players.  Note  
that the players must not be allowed to demand these  
options; it's purely the decision of the Game Master.
Point Swapping:   Allow the player to "move" points  
from one Ability Score to another, at a rate of -2 to one  
score for each +1 added to the other.  The maximum  
score is still 18 (or the racial maximum if lower), and  
the player should not be allowed to lower any score  
below 9.
Score Swapping:   Let the player exchange any two  
Ability Scores, once per character.
The Full Shuffle:  Let the player arrange the six Ability  
Score  values  as  they  wish.   This  allows  the  most 
customization for the player, but on the other hand you  
may find that all player characters in your campaign  
begin to look very much alike.  It's not uncommon for  
players to "dump" the lowest statistic in Charisma, for  
instance.
Hopeless Characters
Sometimes a player will roll for ability scores, look at  
the  ability  scores  rolled,  and  declare  the  character 
"hopeless."  Of course, no player can be required to  
play a character with less than 9 in the first four scores,  
since  all  four  classes  would  be  unavailable  to  that 
character.  However, you as the Game Master might  
choose to allow the player to reroll a character with  
scores  that  are  overall  below  average  even  if  the 
character isn't as "hopeless" as this.
186


## Page 191

BASIC FANTASY RPG GAME MASTER INFORMATION
Here's  an  alternate  suggestion:   Allow  the  player  to 
"flip" all of their scores by subtracting them from 21.  
This  will  turn  a  roll  of  15  (+1  bonus)  into  a  6  (-1 
penalty) but turn a roll of 3 (-3 penalty) into an 18 (+3  
bonus).  This will result in a character who previously  
had  mostly  penalties  becoming  one  with  mostly  
bonuses.  If this is allowed, all scores must be flipped , 
not just the bad ones!  Doing this ensures the character  
is playable while still allowing the possibility of some  
penalty scores.
It is of course possible to roll all average scores, such  
that the character has neither bonuses nor penalties and 
would not gain any benefit from flipping scores.  The  
choice here should be the player's; if they wish to reroll  
all scores, the GM should probably allow it.
Acquisition of Spells
Clerics have an obvious advantage over Magic-Users, in 
that, in theory, they have access to any spell of any  
level which they can cast.  However, note that Clerics  
are limited in their spell selection based on their deity,  
faith or ethos; for instance, a Cleric of the goddess of  
healing should not be surprised that their deity refuses  
to grant reversed healing spells.  If a Cleric prays for a  
spell that is not allowed, the Game Master may choose  
to grant the character a different spell, or optionally (if  
the deity is angered) no spell at all for that "slot."
Magic-Users begin play knowing two spells, read magic 
plus  one  other  (unless  the  GM  grants  more  starting 
spells).  Each time the character gains a level, they gain  
the ability to cast more spells; in addition, every other  
level the Magic-User gains access to the  next  higher  
level spells (until  all levels are available).   However,  
gaining  the  ability  to  cast  these  spells  does not  
necessarily mean the Magic-User instantly learns new  
spells.
Magic-Users  may  learn  spells  by  being  taught  by  
another  Magic-User,  or  by  studying  another  Magic-
User's spellbook.  If being taught, a spell can be learned  
in  a  single  day;  researching  another  Magic-User's  
spellbook takes one day per spell level.  In either case,  
the spell learned must be  transcribed into the Magic-
User's own spellbook, at a cost of 500 gp per spell level  
transcribed.
A Magic-User may add a new spell of any level they  
may cast at any point; however, spells of higher levels  
may  not  be  learned  or  added  to  the  Magic-User's 
spellbook.   The  Magic-User  must  find  a  teacher  or 
acquire a reference work (such as another Magic-User's  
spellbook) in order to learn new spells, and the cost of  
such is in addition to the costs given above.  Often a  
Magic-User  will  maintain  a  relationship  with  their  
original master, who will teach the character new spells  
either for free or in return for services.  Sometimes two  
Magic-Users will agree to exchange known spells.  In  
many cases the only option available to a Magic-User  
will  be  to  pay  another Magic-User  (often  an  NPC) 
anywhere from 100 gp to 1000 gp per spell level in  
return for such training.
Magic-Users may also create entirely new spells (or alter 
existing spells); see the Magic Research rules, below, for 
details.
Weapon and Armor Restrictions
Several races and classes have weapon and/or armor  
restrictions applied to them.  What happens when a  
player declares that their character is going to use a  
prohibited weapon or wear prohibited armor?
Clerics:  The prohibition against edged weapons is a  
matter of faith for Clerics.  Therefore, if a Cleric uses a  
prohibited  weapon,  they  immediately  lose  access  to 
their spells as well as the power to Turn the Undead.  A  
higher-level NPC Cleric of the same faith must assign  
some quest to the miscreant which must be completed  
in order for the fallen Cleric to atone and regain their  
powers.   If  unrepentant,  the  character  is  changed  
permanently from a Cleric to a Fighter.  Re-calculate  
the character's level, applying the current XP total to the 
Fighter table to determine this.  Hit points and attack  
bonus remain the same; change the attack bonus only  
after a new level is gained as a Fighter, and roll Fighter  
hit dice as normal when levels are gained.
Magic-Users:  These characters are simply untrained in 
any  weapon  other  than  those  normally  allowed  to 
them, and should suffer a -5 attack penalty when using  
any prohibited weapon.  A Magic-User in armor can't  
cast spells at all; any attempt fails, and the spell is lost.
Thieves:  Wearing  armor  heavier,  more  restrictive  
and/or noisier than leather armor prevents the use of  
any  Thief  ability,  including  the  Sneak  Attack  ability. 
Thieves may choose to wear such armor, but this only  
makes them a poor excuse for a Fighter.
Dwarves  and  Halflings:  These  characters  are  
prohibited from  using  large  weapons,  mainly  due  to 
their small stature and relatively low weight.  It's hard to  
swing a weapon when the weapon is trying to swing  
you.   If  such  a  character  tries  to  use  a  prohibited 
weapon, the Game Master may either apply a -5 attack  
penalty based on the difficulty of using the weapon, or  
alternately  declare  the  attempt  unsuccessful,  at  their 
option.

GAME MASTER INFORMATION BASIC FANTASY RPG
Judging Wishes
Wishes  are  one  of  the  most  potentially  unbalancing 
things in the game.  With a carefully worded wish, a  
player character can make sweeping, dramatic changes  
in  the  game  world,  possibly  even  rewriting  history. 
Before  allowing  the  player  characters  in  your  game 
access to even one wish, think about how you will deal  
with it.
Wishes are granted by a variety of beings.  Even when  
a wish comes from a device (a ring or a sword, for  
instance), some extradimensional being, god or devil or  
whatever, has placed that wish in the device.  A wish  
will tend to further the goals of the granting being; if the  
granter is an evil efreeti, for instance, it will attempt to  
twist the meaning or intent of the wish so that it does  
not really accomplish what the player character wants.  
On the other hand, if the granter is one of the good  
powers, it will grant the wish as intended so long as the  
player character isn't being greedy or spiteful.
Game  balance  is  the  main  issue  that  must  be  
considered.   Using  a  wish  to  heal  the  entire  party, 
teleport everyone without error to a distant location, or  
to avoid or redo a catastrophic battle, is reasonable.  A  
wish that a character be restored to life and health is  
reasonable, but a wish that not only restores but also  
improves the character is not.
In  general,  a  wish  is  granted  with  at  least  literal 
accuracy… the words of the wish must be fulfilled.  The  
exception  is  wishes  that  are  unreasonable  for  game 
balance  purposes;  they  are  still  at  least  literally  
interpreted, but may be only partially granted.  In the  
last example above, for instance, the granting power  
would likely restore the character to life and health but  
ignore the "improvements" wished for.
Optional Rules
Death and Dying
The rules state that, at zero hit points, the character is  
dead.  If this is too harsh for you, here are several  
approaches to changing the situation:
Raise Dead :  The first approach doesn't change the  
rules a bit.  Arrange matters so that characters killed in  
an adventure can be easily raised (but at a substantial  
cost).  This not only "deals" with the mortality issue, it  
also soaks up  excess treasure,  preventing  the  player 
characters from becoming too rich to be interested in  
adventuring.  It also tends to reward the cautious (since  
they get to keep their gold more often).
What if the characters don't have enough money when  
they die to afford to be raised?  Allow the local religious 
establishment to  raise dead adventurers in return for  
their indenture… that is, the adventurers, upon being  
restored to life, owe the church or temple the money it  
would have cost to be raised, or an equivalent service. 
Thus, the local religious leaders would have a ready  
pool of adventurers to undertake dangerous missions  
for them.
But the adventurer(s) are dead… how can they agree  
to the indenture?  There are two options:  the priests  
can use  speak with dead  to attain agreement, or the  
adventurers  can  sign  an  agreement  with  the  church 
before leaving on the potentially dangerous adventure.  
The  latter  might  even  be  considered  a  standard  
procedure in some places.
Save vs. Death :  The first actual rule alteration is to  
allow characters reduced to zero hit points to save vs.  
Death Ray to avoid death.  If the save is failed, the  
character is immediately dead, just  as in the normal  
rules.  If the save is made, the character remains alive  
for 2d10 rounds; if the character's wounds are bound  
(or they receive healing magic) within this time frame,  
death is averted.  The character remains unconscious  
for  the  full  2d10  rounds  rolled,  either  dying  if  left 
untreated or awakening if their wounds are bound.
Binding  the wounds  of  the  dying  character stabilizes 
them at zero hit points.  The injured character may not  
move more than a few feet without help, nor fight, nor  
cast spells, until their hit points are again greater than  
zero.  Non-magical healing will require a full week to  
188

BASIC FANTASY RPG GAME MASTER INFORMATION
restore the first hit point; after this, healing proceeds at  
the normal rate.
Magical healing will restore the character to whatever  
total is rolled on the healing die roll (up to the usual  
maximum of course).
Any  spellcaster reduced to zero hit points who then  
survives loses all remaining prepared spells.
This rule might be combined with the suggestions under 
Raise Dead, above.
Negative Hit Points :  Instead of stopping at zero hit  
points, keep track of the current negative figure.  At the  
end of each round after they fall, the character loses an  
additional hit point.  If a total of -10 is reached, the  
character is dead.  Before  this point  is reached, the  
character may have their wounds bound and/or receive  
magical healing, which will stabilize the character.  This  
rule should  not be combined with the Save vs. Death  
option.
Just as with the  Save vs. Death  rule, characters with  
zero hit points may not move more than a few feet  
without help, nor fight, nor cast spells, and spellcasters  
who  survive  being  reduced  to  zero  or  negative  hit 
points lose all currently prepared spells.
As  a  further  option,  the  GM  may  choose  to  use  a 
negative number equal to the character's Constitution  
score rather than a straight -10.
"Save or Die" Poison
Poisons, as described in the Encounter and Monster  
sections, kill characters instantly.  Game Masters may  
find this makes the mortality rate of player characters a  
bit too high.  On the other hand, poisons  should  be 
scary.  Here's an optional rule which makes things a bit  
easier without entirely removing the fear from poison:
Where a "save or die" poison is indicated, the victim  
must make a save vs. Poison or suffer 1d6 points of  
damage  per  round  for  6  rounds,  starting  the  round 
following the exposure to the poison; this is an average  
of 21 points of damage, but even a first level character  
might survive with a combination of luck and healing  
magic.  The GM may create poisons which vary from  
these figures, of course.  If the  Negative Hit Points  
optional rule is being used, it is suggested to increase  
the  poison  duration  to  10  rounds  (an  average  35 
points).
Ability Rolls
There will be times when a player character tries to do  
something  in  the  game  that  seems  to  have  no  rule 
covering it.  In some of those cases, the only attribute  
the PC has that seems appropriate may be an Ability  
Score.  Here is a suggested method for making rolls  
against  Ability  Scores  that  still  gives  better  odds  to 
higher level characters:
The player rolls 1d20 and adds their Ability Bonus for  
the score the GM thinks is most appropriate, as well as  
any  bonus  or penalty  the GM assigns.   Consult  the 
following table.  If the total rolled is equal to or higher  
than the given Target number, the roll is a success.

GAME MASTER INFORMATION BASIC FANTASY RPG
Human Experience Bonus Option
Some Game Masters find that the standard 10% bonus  
to earned  experience for Human player characters is  
not enough to encourage people to play as Humans.  If  
you feel that this is the case in your campaign, there is  
absolutely no reason not to give double that bonus.  
Because  of  the  exponential  (doubling)  nature  of  the 
character  advancement  tables  from  1st to  9 th levels,  
giving  a larger bonus will not  significantly unbalance  
your game in any way.
Awarding Experience Points for 
Treasure Gained
The Game Master may also assign experience points for 
treasure gained, at a rate of 1 GP = 1 XP.  This is  
optional;  GMs  wishing  to  advance  their  players  to 
higher levels more quickly may choose to do this, while  
those preferring a more leisurely pace should omit it.  If  
experience  is  awarded  for  treasure,  it  should  be  
awarded only for treasure acquired and returned to a  
place  of  safety.   Alternately,  the  GM  may  require 
treasure to be spent on training in order to count it for  
experience.  This is a highly effective way to remove  
excess treasure from the campaign.
Thief Abilities
Some  players  of  Thieves  may  wish  to  have  more 
control over their Thief abilities.  If you study the Thief  
Abilities table, you'll discover its secret:  from levels 2-9,  
the  Thief  improves  30  percentiles  (total)  each  level; 
from levels 10-15, 20 percentiles; and from level 16 on,  
10 percentiles.  If you wish to allow Thief customization, 
simply let the player allocate these points as they wish  
rather than following the table.  Allow no more than 10  
percentiles to be added to any single Thief ability per  
level gain.  Note also that no Thief ability may be raised  
above 99 percent.
Preparing Spells From Memory
Sometimes a Magic-User will want to prepare spells, but 
their spellbook may be unavailable; this includes when  
the book has been destroyed or stolen as well as times  
when the Magic-User has been captured or trapped.
A  Magic-User  can  always prepare  read magic  from  
memory.  Other spells require an Intelligence ability roll, 
as described above, with the spell level as a penalty on  
the die roll.
Failure exhausts the spell slot being prepared, just as if  
it had been successfully prepared and then cast; so if a  
5th level Magic-User attempts to prepare  fireball from  
memory, and fails, they will have no 3 rd level spells for  
the day.

BASIC FANTASY RPG GAME MASTER INFORMATION
Magical Research
General Rules for Research
At some point a Magic-User or Cleric may wish to start  
creating magic items or inventing spells.  This is termed  
magical research .  For  any  research,  a Magic-User  
must have a tower or laboratory, while a Cleric requires  
a properly consecrated temple or church of their faith.  
In addition, there will be a cost for the creation of each  
item, a minimum time required to create it, and a given  
chance of success.  If the roll fails, generally the time  
and  money  are  wasted  and  the  procedure  must  be 
started again from the beginning; however, consult the  
detailed rules below for exceptions.
In almost all cases, the Game Master should make this  
roll in secret.   There are many situations where the  
character (or the player) should not know whether the  
roll has actually failed, or whether the GM has decided  
the research is impossible for the character.  The GM  
may  decide  to  tell  the  player  that  the  research  is 
impossible if the roll succeeds; if the roll is a failure, that  
is all the player should be told.
In  general,  Clerics  may  only  create  magic  items  
reproducing the effects of Clerical spells; Clerics may  
also make enchanted weapons and armor, even those  
sorts which they may not use themselves (since they  
may be creating weapons or armor for other followers  
of  their  faith).   Magic-Users  may  create  any  sort  of 
magic item except for those reproducing Clerical spells  
for which no equivalent Magic-User spell exists.
Time spent doing magical research must be eight-hour  
days with interruptions lasting no more than two days.  
Longer interruptions result in failure of the project.
The  GM  may  wish  to  grant  Experience  Points  to 
characters who successfully complete magical research.  
It is suggested that the rate of such awards be 1 XP per  
10  gp  spent  on  the  research.   This  award  may  be 
granted for all research, or only for creation of magic  
items,  or  not  at  all  if  the  GM  prefers  to  emphasize 
adventuring for advancement purposes.
Spell Research
Researching new spells is the most common type of  
magical  research.   A  Magic-User  may  research  a  
standard  spell,  removing  the  need  for  a  teacher  or 
reference;  alternately,  a  Cleric  or  Magic-User  may 
invent an entirely new spell.  No character may invent  
or research a spell of a higher level than they can cast.
If the character is inventing a new spell, the GM must  
determine the spell's level and judge whether or not the  
spell is possible "as is."  The GM does not have to tell  
the player whether the spell is possible, and in fact this  
may be preferable.
The cost to research a spell is 1,000 gp per spell level  
for "standard" spells,  or 2,000 gp per spell level for  
newly  invented  spells;  in  either  case,  one  week  is 
required per spell level to complete the research.  The  
chance of success is 25%, plus 5% per level  of  the  
character,  minus  10%  per  level  of  the  spell;  the  
maximum chance of success is 95%.
If the research roll is successful, the character may add  
the spell to their spellbook (if a Magic-User) or may  
subsequently  pray  for  the  spell  (if  a  Cleric).   On  a 
failure,  the  money  and  time  are  spent  to  no  avail. 
Clerics of the same deity, faith or ethos may teach each  
other the prayers required to access new spells; this  
takes  one  hour  per  spell  level.   The  procedure  to 
exchange  spells  with  other  Magic-Users  has  already 
been explained (under Acquisition of Spells, above).
As  mentioned  above,  the  GM  may  decide  that  a 
proposed new spell is not "correct" for their campaign;  
too powerful, too low in level, etc.  Rather than tell the  
player this, there are two strategies that may be used.
First, the Game Master may decide to revise the spell.  
If the roll is a success, the GM then presents the player  
with a revised writeup of the spell, adjusted however  
the GM feels necessary for game balance purposes.
The  alternative,  more  appropriate  when  the  GM  
believes the spell should be higher level than the player  
character can cast, is to make the roll anyway.  If the  
roll fails, that is all the player needs to know; but if it  
succeeds,  the  GM  should  then  show  the  player  the 
revised  version  of  the  spell  and  explain  that  the  
character may try again when they attain a high enough 
level to cast it.  In this case, the GM may allow the  
character to reduce either the time or the cost by half  
when the research is attempted again at the new level.

GAME MASTER INFORMATION BASIC FANTASY RPG
Magic Item Research
Any character who wishes to create magical items must  
know all (if any) spells to be imbued in the item.  Items  
that produce effects not matching any known spell may  
require  additional  research  (to  devise  the  unknown 
spell) if the GM so desires.
Some  magic  items  require  one  or  more  special  
components that cannot usually be bought.  Special  
components can only be used once on such a project.  
For  example,  the  GM  might  require  the skin  of  a  
deceiver to create a Cloak of Deception , or mountain  
dragon saliva to create a Wand of Fireballs.  Note that 
there are specific rules for components under  Other 
Magic Items, below.
Special  component  requirements  are  entirely  at  the 
option of the Game Master, and are usually employed  
to slow the creation of powerful magic items that might  
tend to unbalance the campaign.  It's also a way to lead  
the spellcaster (and their party) to new adventures.
Chance of Success
Unless  given  differently  below,  the  base  chance  of 
success creating a magic item is 15% plus 5% per level  
of the spellcaster, plus the spellcaster's full Intelligence  
(if a Magic-User) or Wisdom (if a Cleric).  Thus, a 9 th 
level spellcaster with a 15 Prime Requisite has a base  
chance of 75%.
Spell Scrolls
A spellcaster may create a scroll containing any spell  
they have access to (for a Magic-User, spells in their  
spellbook; for a Cleric, any spell the character might  
successfully pray for).  The cost is 50 gp per spell level,  
and the time required is 1 day per spell level.  Reduce  
the chance of success based on the level of the spell  
being inscribed, at a rate of -10% per level.
If the roll fails, the enchantment of the scroll has failed;  
however, if the caster tries again to inscribe the same  
spell, either the cost or the time is reduced by half (at  
the player's option, if a player character is involved).
Other Single-Use Items
Scrolls (other  than  spell  scrolls),  potions,  and a  few 
other  items  (such  as  the  Rod  of  Cancellation)  are 
single-use  items.   These  items  may  be  created  by 
Magic-Users or Clerics of the 7th level or higher.
The chance of success is as given for scrolls, above,  
when the item being created reproduces a known spell  
(or when the GM decides a spell must be created, as  
described above).  For other types of items, the GM  
should assign a spell level as they see fit, and the cost  
and time required is doubled (making up for the spell  
research or knowledge  required for spell-reproducing  
items).  The time required is one week plus one day per 
spell level (or equivalent), and the cost to enchant the  
item is 50 gp per spell level, per day.
Potions  are  a  special  case;  the  character  creating  a 
potion may make a large batch, consisting of several  
doses,  which  may  be  bottled  in  separate  vials  or 
combined in a larger flask.  For each additional dose  
created at the same time, reduce the chance of success  
by  5%  and  increase  the  time  required  by  one  day. 
Note  that  increasing  the  time  required  will  directly 
increase the cost, but the cost is for the entire batch, not 
per dose, effectively giving a discount to the cost per  
dose.  If the roll to create the item fails, the entire batch  
is spoiled.
192


## Page 197

BASIC FANTASY RPG GAME MASTER INFORMATION
The assistance of an alchemist (found in the Specialists 
section on page 47) adds 15% to the chance of success  
of a Magic-User or Cleric creating a potion.
Permanent Magic Items
Creating  permanent  magic  items  (rings,  weapons,  
wands,  staves,  and most  miscellaneous  magic  items) 
requires a Magic-User or Cleric of the 9th level or higher.
When enchanting an item with multiple abilities, each  
ability of the item requires a separate roll for success;  
the first failed roll ends the enchantment process.  Such  
an item will still perform the powers or effects already  
successfully  enchanted  into  it,  but  no  further  
enchantment is possible.
Permanent magic items, including weapons (described  
in  detail  below),  must  be  created  from  high-quality 
items.    The cost of such items will generally be ten  
times the normal cost for such an item.
Enchanting Weapons and Armor
The  base  cost  of  enchanting  a  weapon  or  armor  is 
1,000 gp per point of bonus.  For weapons with two  
bonuses, divide the larger bonus in half (don't round)  
and add the smaller bonus; thus, a Sword +1, +3 vs.  
Dragons would cost 2,500 gp to enchant.  Enchanting  
a weapon takes one week plus two days per point of  
bonus; thus, the sword described would require twelve  
days to enchant.
Reduce the chance of success by 10% times the bonus;  
so, a  Sword +1  would reduce the base chance 10%,  
while the Sword +1, +3 vs. Dragons  described above  
would  reduce  the  base  chance  25%.   Further,  the 
chance of success may be increased 25% by doubling  
the  cost  and  time  required  (this  decision  must  be 
announced before the roll is made).
For weapons  having additional powers,  combine  the  
rules above with the rules for creating permanent items.  
All  enchantments  must  be  applied  in  a  single  
enchantment "session."
At  the  GM's  option,  hiring  a  master  armorer  or  
weaponsmith  (one  good  enough  to  charge  twice  
normal rates as given in the Specialists subsection on 
page 47) might add 15% to the chance of success.
Other Magic Items
Magic items can have several  features.  Each feature  
added to a magic item increases the cost and the time  
required, and decreases the chance of success.  The  
features are as follows:
Creates a spell or spell-like effect :  This is the basic  
feature of all non-weapon magic items.  The base cost  
of  this  enchantment  is  500  gp  per  spell  level;  time 
required is five days plus two days per level.  If the  
magic item has multiple spell or spell-like effects, add  
the  cost  and  time  figures  together.   The  chance  of 
success is reduced 5% per spell level.
Has multiple charges:  This includes, of course, wands 
and staffs, but several other magic items would also  
have charges.  Each spell or spell-like effect normally  
has a separate pool of charges (but see next).  The  
table below shows the various maximum charge levels  
and the associated cost, time and chance adjustments:
Charge 
Level
Cost per 
Charge
Charges per 
Day
Chance
2-3 +150 gp 1 - 5%
4-7 +125 gp 2 - 10%
8-20 +100 gp 3 - 20%
21-30 +75 gp 4 - 30%
When using the table above, don't count the first charge 
for cost or time purposes.  Note that each separate pool  
of charges in the item must be figured separately.
Item can be recharged:  Figure the additional cost and 
time,  and the  penalty  to  the  chance  of  success,  for 
rechargeable items as being exactly twice the figures  
from the table above; so, creating a rechargeable item  
with 3 charges costs 600 gp more rather than 300 gp  
more, and takes two days per charge (or four extra  
days); the chance of success is lowered 10% rather than 
5%.
Item recharges itself:   Creating a self-recharging item  
is  expensive;  apply  the  following  adjustments  to  the 
charge cost, time and chance for items that recharge  
193


## Page 198

GAME MASTER INFORMATION BASIC FANTASY RPG
automatically.  Note that self-recharging items are never  
"rechargeable" in that they may not be recharged other  
than by themselves.
Charging 
Rate
Cost Time Chance
1 per day x 3 x 2 - 10%
All per day x 5 x 3 - 30%
All per week x 4 x 2 - 20%
Charges are generic:  This means that all the effects of  
the item draw power from the same pool of charges;  
most Magic-User staffs are in this category.  Items with  
generic charges are always rechargeable; don't  apply  
the normal costs for this feature.  Instead, combine the  
normal costs for the charge pools of each effect (which  
must all have the same number of charges), and then  
divide the charge cost, time and chance adjustments by  
two.  Thus, two effects sharing one pool costs the same  
as a single effect with a single pool.
Item may be used by any class:   By default, magic  
items may only be used by the class that created them;  
so  a  Wand of Fireballs  is  normally  usable  only  by 
Magic-Users,  or  a  Staff of Healing  only  by  Clerics. 
This feature allows the item to be used by any class of  
character,  and  involves  assigning  simple  command 
words and gestures to the item.  Adding this feature  
costs 1,000 gp per effect.  Note that all the item's effects 
do not have to be covered; it is possible to create an  
item where some effects may be used by any class, but  
other effects may only be used by the creator's class.
Item operates continuously or automatically:   This  
feature  supersedes  both  the  charges  and  item  use 
features.  The item works whenever properly worn, or  
activates automatically when required.  A Ring of Fire  
Resistance is  a  good  example;  also,  the  Ring  of 
Invisibility is  in  this  category.   Adding  this  feature 
multiplies  the  final  cost  and  time  figures  by  3  and 
applies a 20% penalty to the chance of success.
Each feature above applied to a magic item will require  
a valuable, rare and/or magical material to support the  
enchantment. For example, a wand of fireballs has a  
spell effect that is powered by charges; these are two  
relatively ordinary features, so the Magic-User creating  
the  item  proposes  a  rare  wood  for  the  shaft  and  a 
1,000 gp  value  ruby  for  the  tip.  The  GM  may,  of 
course, require something more rare or valuable if the  
magic item is particularly powerful.
The base cost of a spell effect feature can be reduced  
by 25% by applying limits to the ability. For example, a  
Ring of Charm Dryad is an example of limited charm 
person spell  effect,  which  would  qualify  for  the  
deduction.  This does not affect the chance of success  
or the time required.
Weapons which are to be enchanted with additional  
powers other than the normal bonus require combining  
the standard weapon enchantment rules with the rules  
given above.  Perform the weapon enchantment first; if  
it  is  successful,  then  the  character  enchanting  the 
weapon  must  immediately  (within  two  days,  as  
previously explained) begin the spell or spell-like power  
enchantment process.  Failure of the second procedure  
does not spoil the weapon enchantment.
Cursed Items
Some cursed items, such as cursed scrolls, are created  
that way specifically by the spellcaster.  The difficulty of  
creating  such  an  item  is  roughly  the  same  as  the 
difficulty of creating a spell scroll of bestow curse.
Other cursed magic items may be the result of a failed  
attempt to create a useful item.  The GM must decide  
whether or not a failed research project will actually  
create a cursed item.

BASIC FANTASY RPG GAME MASTER INFORMATION
Creating a Dungeon Adventure
1. Think About Why
When creating a dungeon, the first question you must  
answer is:  Why will your player characters risk going  
into this dangerous dungeon full of monsters and traps?
Here are some possible scenarios:
To Explore the Unknown:   This is common in pulp  
fiction.  One or more of the player characters has heard  
of some ancient site, and wishes to explore purely for  
knowledge.   Possibly  some  of  the  other  player  
characters are involved for other reasons.
To  Battle  An  Evil  Incursion:  Goblins  are  raiding  
farms in the area, and the Baron has offered a reward  
for stopping the raids; the player characters are happy  
to help.
To Rescue A Kidnapped Victim:   Some friend of the  
player characters has been kidnapped, and they must  
sneak into or storm the villain's tower/cave/dungeon to  
rescue the victim.  Or, perhaps, the victim is the son or  
daughter of the local Baron or a wealthy merchant who  
offers a reward for the safe return of their offspring.
To Fulfill A Quest:   The local church, to whom the  
player characters owe a favor, would like an ancient  
relic recovered from a lost mountain fortress, and the  
High Priest asks them to look into it; or some similar  
task might be assigned, depending on who the player  
characters owe a favor.
To Get Loot:   This is a surprisingly common scenario  
(well,  perhaps  not  so  surprising).   The  dungeon  is 
rumored to contain a hidden treasure of great value,  
and the first characters to find it will be rich!  Of course,  
the  treasure  might  not  be  that  huge,  and  might  be 
guarded by any number of horrific monsters…
To Escape Confinement:   The player characters have  
been  captured  by  an  enemy,  and  find  themselves 
incarcerated  without  their  weapons,  armor,  or  
equipment.  This scenario must be used with care, as  
the  GM  must  not  be  seen  to  be  "railroading"  the 
characters into the adventure.
There are many other possible scenarios, and each has  
many variations.  Knowing the answer to this question  
will make the next questions easier to answer.
2. What Kind Of Setting Is It?
Is the dungeon beneath a ruined fortress, or an ancient  
wizard's tower?  Or perhaps it's a natural cave, which  
has been expanded by kobolds… or the tomb of an  
ancient  barbarian  warlord,  guarded  by  undead  
monsters… there are many possibilities.
3. Choose Special Monsters
Now you know why the player characters want to go  
there  (or  why  they  will,  when  they  learn  of  the 
dungeon), and you know what sort of place it is.  Next,  
decide what special monsters you will place within.  For  
instance,  the  natural  cave  expanded  by  kobolds  
contains kobolds, obviously, while the warlord's tomb  
contains some undead, zombies and skeletons perhaps.
4. Draw The Dungeon Map
Dungeon maps can be drawn on graph paper in pencil,  
or created on the computer with any of a broad variety  
of dungeon-drawing programs.  (If you like the design  
of the maps in the official Basic Fantasy RPG adventure 
modules, be sure to visit www.basicfantasy.org and try  
out our map designer, MapMatic +2.)  When creating a  
dungeon for personal use, there is certainly no good  
reason  not  to  use  pencil  and  paper.   Below  is  an 
example  of  a  hand-drawn  dungeon  map,  with  the 
various symbols noted:
5. Stock The Dungeon
"Stocking" the dungeon refers to assigning contents to  
each  room.   There  are  several  possibilities;  a  room 
might  contain  a  monster (which  might  or  might  not 
have treasure), a trap (which might guard a treasure, or  
might  not),  an  "unguarded"  treasure,  a  "special"  
(something  other  than  a  monster,  trap,  or  treasure; 
often a puzzle of some sort), or be "empty."
195


## Page 200

GAME MASTER INFORMATION BASIC FANTASY RPG
The GM may choose the contents of any room, or may  
roll on the table below:
d% Contents
01-16 Empty
17-20 Unguarded Treasure
21-60 Monster
61-84 Monster with Treasure
85-88 Special
89-96 Trap
97-00 Trap with Treasure
An unguarded treasure will generally be hidden (such  
as in a secret room, inside an unusual container, etc.)  
or protected by a trap (a poison needle in the lock of a  
chest,  or  a  poison  gas  canister  that  explodes  if  the 
container  is  opened,  or  something  similar);  such  a 
treasure might even be hidden  and  trapped!  Again,  
some sort of saving throw should be allowed if a trap is  
used.  It's not a bad idea to hide a treasure so well that  
the player characters are unlikely to find it; don't be  
concerned if they don't.  If you give away the location  
of all your unguarded treasures, your players will not  
appreciate it properly when they manage to find one by  
cleverness or luck.
A  monster might be selected by the GM or rolled on  
the random encounter tables.  It's traditional that the  
first level (below ground) contains monsters of 1 hit die  
or less, the second level contains monsters of around 2  
hit dice, and so on, but the GM may choose to arrange  
their dungeon in any way desired.
A  monster with treasure  might indicate a lair, or it  
might be a group of monsters carrying loot, possibly  
camping for some reason before moving on.
A  trap is, obviously, some sort of device intended to  
harm  the  player characters,  including  such  things  as 
pendulum blades, hidden pits, spear-chucking devices,  
and so forth.   A  trap with treasure  is such  a  trap  
protecting  a  treasure,  which  might  be  in  the  room 
beyond the trap or actually within it (such as in a pit).  
See the Traps section, below, for more information.
A  special might be a puzzle of some sort, such as a  
door  that  can  only  be  opened  by  a  combination 
(hidden  elsewhere  in  the  dungeon);  or  perhaps  an 
oracle that answers questions about the dungeon (but  
possibly  it  lies).   The  classic  "magic  fountain"  that 
randomly changes the ability scores of the drinker is  
another possibility; if this is done, some sort of limit  
should be imposed (such as, the device only affects a  
given creature once, or the device causes harm more  
often than it gives aid) to prevent abuse.  In general, a  
"special" room is any room containing something that  
either interests or obstructs the player characters but is  
not a monster, trap, or unguarded treasure.
Empty rooms contain no monsters, traps, unguarded  
treasures, or specials.  This does not mean that they are  
truly  "empty";  a  room  might  contain  a  fireplace,  
upholstered  chairs,  side  tables,  torch  sconces,  and 
curtains, and still be considered empty.  Hide a treasure  
in a secret drawer in a side table, and it becomes an  
unguarded treasure room; in other words, to be empty  
there has to be basically nothing of serious interest to  
the player characters in the room.
6. Finishing Touches
The  GM  may  wish  to  create  one  or  more  custom 
wandering  monster  tables  for  the  dungeon;  monster 
patrols, if any, may need to be described; and possibly  
some  locations  may  have  unusual  sounds,  smells, 
graffiti, etc. which need to be noted.  Don't spend too  
much time on this, though.
Remember, if you only detail the "interesting" things,  
your players will begin to guess what might be in a  
room.  Some extra description will help make things  
uncertain for the players.  For instance, a room with an  
unguarded treasure:
Game Master:   This room contains a chest, centered  
against the far wall.
Player 1:   We look for monsters, and if we don't see  
any, the thief will check the chest for traps.
Kind of boring, right?  This might be better:
Game Master:  In this room you see a comfortable-
looking upholstered chair, a side table with a drawer  
and a foot stool.  Two burned-out torches are held by  
sconces on each wall.
Player 1:  If we don't see any monsters, the thief will  
check the table and the footstool for traps and see if  
anything is hidden inside them, while the rest of us  
check for secret doors… one of those sconces might  
open one.
A little extra detail can add a lot to the adventure.

BASIC FANTASY RPG GAME MASTER INFORMATION
Traps 
Some suggestions of typical traps are listed below, to  
assist  the  GM.   Deadlier  traps  can  be  created  by 
combining simple traps, by making their effects harder  
to avoid, or by making them capable of dealing more  
damage. 
Traps are not necessarily reliable; the GM may choose  
to make a roll of some sort for each potential victim  
until the trap is sprung (say, 1-2 on 1d6).  Or, a trap  
door might not open until a given weight is placed on it, 
so  that  a  lightly  loaded  thief  might  cross  without 
difficulty, only to see his heavily armored warrior ally  
fall victim to it.
Alarm:  Everyone  within  a  30'  radius  must  save  vs. 
Spells or be deafened for 1d8 turns by the loud noise.  
The  GM  should  check  immediately  for  wandering 
monsters,  which,  if  indicated,  will  arrive  in  2d10  
rounds.
Arrow Trap:  A hidden, mounted crossbow attacks at  
AB +1, doing 1d6+1 points of damage on a successful  
hit.
Chute:  These are usually covered with a hidden trap  
door. The triggering character must save vs. Death Ray  
(with Dexterity bonus added) or tumble down to lower  
level of the dungeon.  Chutes usually do little or no  
damage to the victim.
Falling stones or bricks:   Rocks fall from the ceiling.  
The  triggering  character  must  save  vs.  Paralysis  or 
Petrify  (with  Dexterity  bonus  added)  or  take  1d10 
points of damage.
Flashing Light:  With a loud snap, a bright light goes  
off in the face of the character that triggered the trap.  
That character, and anyone else looking directly at it,  
must save vs. Spells or be blinded for 1d8 turns.
Monster-Attracting  Spray:  A  strong-smelling  but  
harmless liquid is sprayed on the triggering character.  
The  smell  attracts  predatory  creatures,  doubling  the 
chances of wandering monsters for 1d6 hours or until  
washed off.
Oil Slick:  Oil is sprayed onto the floor of the room.  
Anyone trying to walk through the oil must save vs.  
Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added) or fall prone.  
Oil is highly flammable and may be ignited by torches  
or other flame sources held by characters who slip and  
fall into it.
Pit Trap:  Usually hidden with a breakable cover, trap  
door, or illusion.  The victim must save vs. Death Ray  
(with Dexterity bonus added) or fall into the pit, taking  
damage according to the distance fallen (see "Falling  
Damage").  A pit trap can be made deadlier by placing  
spikes, acid, or dangerous creatures at the bottom, or  
partly  filling  it  with  water  to  represent  a  drowning 
hazard.
Poison  Dart  Trap: A  spring-loaded  dart  launcher  
attacks at AB +1 for 1d4 points of damage, and the  
victim must save vs. Poison or die.
Poison Gas:  Gas emerges from vents to fill the room.  
All within the affected area must save vs. Poison or die.  
Poison gases are sometimes highly flammable and may  
be  ignited  by  torches  or  other  flame  sources,  doing 
perhaps 1d6 points of damage to each character in the  
area of effect (with a save vs. Dragon Breath allowed to  
avoid the damage).
Poison  Needle  Trap:   A  tiny,  spring-loaded  needle 
pops  out  of  a  keyhole  or  other  small  aperture  and 
injects  poison  into  the  finger  of  the  character  who 
triggered the trap (most likely, a Thief trying to pick the  
lock), who must save vs. Poison or die.
Portcullis:  A  falling  gate  blocks  the  passage.   The 
character who triggered the trap must save vs. Death  
Ray or take 3d6 points of damage.
Rolling Boulder Trap:   A spherical or cylindrical rock  
rolls down a slanting corridor.  Anyone in its path must  
save vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added) or  
take 2d6 points of damage.  Alternately, if the corridor  
has no other place for the character to escape to (that  
is, no room for the character to step out of the path of  
the rock), it may be necessary to outrun the rock to  
avoid the damage.
Blade Trap:   A blade or spear drops down from the  
ceiling or pops out of the wall and attacks at AB +1 for  
1d8 points of damage.  Particularly large blades might  
attack everyone along a 10' or 20' line.
Triggered Spell:  When activated, a spell of the GM's  
choice is cast, targeting or centered on the character  
who  triggered  it.   Popular  choices  include  curses,  
illusions, or a wall of fire.

GAME MASTER INFORMATION BASIC FANTASY RPG
Designing a Wilderness Adventure
1. Think About Why
This is much the same task as was described above.  
The  player  characters  may  enter  a  particular  area 
looking for a town to resupply from, a church or temple  
to provide healing services, or for many other reasons.  
Once  in  the  area,  the  Game  Master  can  make  the 
player characters aware of adventuring opportunities in  
the area, by means of rumors, posted bounties (such as  
for raiding humanoids), quests offered by local clergy,  
and so forth.
2. What Kind Of Setting Is It?
Decide whether the area is deep in the wilderness, or in  
more inhabited territories, what sort of climate will be  
found there, how many towns, and of what size, are  
present, and so on.
You may choose to design a new territory based on the  
goals of the player characters in your campaign.  For  
example, if the player characters decide to seek their  
fortunes  in  the  richest  city  in  the  world,  you  could 
decide  where  this  is  and  begin  to  describe  it  by 
providing rumors of its wealth and splendor told by far-
wandering merchants.  If these descriptions intrigue the  
characters and they travel toward the city, you will have  
time to decide what terrain – and dangers – lie in their  
path.
On the other hand, your setting should make sense,  
which will help players make meaningful choices when  
traveling.  For example, areas under human control will  
be settled, with signs of civilization such as cleared land  
for  agriculture,  roads,  strongholds,  etc.   Areas  
dominated by humanoid monsters, or which are being  
raided by wandering humanoids, will be battle-scarred  
and will not have food or other goods available.  A  
valley that was settled many years ago but abandoned  
after a dragon attacked could contain ruined buildings,  
their walls likely still bearing the marks of flame and  
claw, and fields grown high with saplings. 
3. Draw An Area Map
Now it's time  to draw the  area  map.   Some  Game  
Masters prefer to draw maps freehand, while others like  
to use hex or graph paper; of course, programs are  
available to create maps on a computer as well.  It is a  
good idea to provide a scale for the map, which can be 
whatever best fits the map and the area you want to  
depict.  A scale of 18 miles per square or hex is a good  
choice for a large-scale map, as this is the distance that  
a group of humans can cover in a day in clear terrain  
(see  Wilderness  Movement  Rates),  which  makes  it 
easy to determine travel times.
Rivers and coastline, hills and mountains, forests and  
plains must be clear on the map.  All of these areas  
should have an appropriate climate: for example, the  
windward side of a mountain range will usually receive  
a great deal of rain, while the other side will be dry.  
You  may  choose  to  create  an  area  with  abnormal 
weather for its location, such as a sandy desert in the  
midst of a rain forest, but this should be unusual, a tip  
to observant players that strange magic is involved.
Go ahead and place any interesting sites such as towns,  
ruins, and significant monster lairs.  Remember, in most  
cases your party of adventurers will need some base of  
operations, be it a city, town, village, or border fortress.
4. Detail Interesting Sites And People
Describe at least the base town, and the dungeon you  
expect the party to visit first.  Also detail any set or  
placed  encounters  you  laid  out  in  the  step  above. 
There is a lot  of room  for creativity here: a distant,  
unfamiliar town may have different laws, traditions, or  
currency.  You should also describe key NPCs and their 
connections to each other.  NPCs have their own goals  
and plans, which may or may not involve the PCs, and  
the actions of player characters toward one person will  
often  influence  how  others  treat  them.   Don't  go  
overboard  trying  to  detail  every  single  place  on  the 
map… leave some room for expansion later, after you  
have a feel for your players and their characters.
5. Create Encounter Tables
When designing a wilderness area, one touch that will  
really set it apart is a custom encounter table.  Choose  
those monsters that seem most appropriate to the area,  
using the standard encounter tables as a guide.  If you  
have placed humanoid lairs or encampments, you may  
wish to include their patrols on the custom table.
Another alternative is to roll six or eight or ten random  
encounters using the "generic" encounter table for the  
relevant terrain type, and use that list as your random  
encounter table for the area.  When doing this, you  
probably should re-roll duplicates.
