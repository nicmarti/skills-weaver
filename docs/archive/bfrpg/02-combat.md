ADVENTURE BASIC FANTASY RPG
Retainers, Specialists and Mercenaries
Player characters will sometimes want or need to hire  
NPCs  (Non-Player  Characters)  to  work  for  them.  
There are several categories of NPCs available for hire,  
as follows:
Retainers
A  retainer  is  a  close  associate  of  his  employer.  
Retainers are hired for a share of treasure (typically at  
least 15% of the employer's income) plus support costs  
(weapons,  armor,  rations,  and  basic  equipment  
provided by the employer).  Retainers are typically very  
loyal  and  are  willing  to  take  reasonable  risks;  in  
particular, they are the only sort of hireling who will  
generally  accompany  a  player  character  into  a  
dungeon, lair, or ruin.
Hiring  a  retainer  is  more  involved  than  hiring  other 
NPCs.  First, the player character must advertise for a  
retainer, typically by hiring a crier, posting notices in  
public  places,  or asking  (and  possibly  paying)  NPCs 
such  as  innkeepers  or  taverners  to  direct  potential 
retainers to the player character.  It is up to the Game  
Master  to  rule  on  what  must  be  done,  and  how 
successful these activities are.
If the player character is successful, one or more NPCs  
will present themselves to be interviewed.  The Game  
Master should play out the interview with the player,  
and after all offers have been made and all questions  
asked, a reaction roll should be made.  To check the  
potential retainer's reaction, the Game Master rolls 2d6  
and adds the player character's  Charisma bonus.  In  
addition, the Game Master may apply any adjustments  
they feel are appropriate (a bonus of +1 for higher-
than-average pay or the offer of a magic item such as a  
Sword +1 , or a penalty if the player character offers  
poor terms).  The roll is read as follows:
Adjusted Die Roll Result
2 or less Refusal, -1 on further rolls
3-5 Refusal
6-8 Try again
9-11 Acceptance
12 or more Acceptance, +1 to Loyalty
Refusal,  -1  on  further  rolls means  that  all  further 
reaction rolls made toward that player character in the  
given town or region will be at a penalty of -1 due to  
unkind words said by the NPC to his fellows.  If the  
player  character  tries  again  in  a  different  town,  the 
penalty does not apply.
If a  Try again result is rolled, the potential retainer is  
reluctant,  and  needs  more  convincing;  the  player  
character must "sweeten" the deal in order to get an  
additional roll, such as by offering more pay, a magic  
item, etc.  If the player character makes no better offer,  
treat Try again as a Refusal result.
Loyalty:  All retainers have a Loyalty score, which is  
generally  7  plus  the  employer's  Charisma  bonus  (or 
penalty).  The Loyalty score is used just as the Morale 
score of monsters or mercenaries is used.  
If a Loyalty check roll made in combat is a natural 2,  
the Loyalty of the retainer increases by +1 point.  Note  
that a Loyalty of 12 is fanatical… the retainer will do  
virtually anything the player character asks, and never  
flees in combat.  However, the Game Master should still 
apply penalties when the player character instructs the  
retainer  to  do  something  which  appears  very  risky, 
making a failed check possible.
In  addition,  the  Game  Master  should  roll  a  Loyalty 
check for each retainer at the end of each adventure,  
after treasure is divided, to determine if the retainer will  
remain with the player character.  The GM may apply  
adjustments to this roll,  probably no more  than two  
points plus or minus, if the retainer is particularly well or 
poorly paid.
Maximum Number of Retainers:   A player character  
may hire at most 4 retainers, adjusted by the character's 
Charisma bonus or penalty.  Any attempts to hire more  
than this number of retainers will be met with automatic 
refusals.
Level of Retainers:   Normally, potential retainers will  
be one-half the level of the employer (or less).  So, a  
first level character cannot hire retainers, second level  
PCs can only hire first level characters, and so on.  Of  
course,  there  is  no  way  for  the  retainers  to  directly 
know  the  level  of  the  PC  employer,  nor  for  the 
employer to know the level of the potential retainer; but 
the Game Master should usually enforce this rule for  
purposes of game balance.  It shouldn't be surprising  
that  first  level characters can't  hire  retainers,  as they 
have no reputation to speak of yet.
Experience for Retainers:   Unlike other hired NPCs,  
retainers do gain experience just as other adventurers  
do;  however,  as they  are  under  the  command  of  a 
player  character,  only  one-half  of  a  share  of  XP is  
allocated  to  each  retainer.   See  Character 
Advancement, below, for an example.

BASIC FANTASY RPG ADVENTURE
Specialists
Specialists  are  NPCs  who  may  be  hired  by  player 
characters to perform various tasks.  Specialists do not  
go on adventures or otherwise risk their lives fighting  
monsters,  disarming  traps,  or  any  of  the  other  
dangerous things player characters and retainers may  
do.   Rather,  specialists  perform  services  the  player 
characters  usually  can't  perform  for  themselves,  like 
designing  and  erecting  castles,  training  animals,  or 
operating ships.
A player character is limited in the number of specialists  
they can hire only by the amount of money they cost;  
Charisma does not affect this.
Alchemist:  1,000 gp per month.  These characters are 
generally hired for one of two reasons: to make potions, 
or to assist a Magic-User with magical research.
An alchemist can produce a potion, given the required  
materials and a sample  or a written formula  for the  
potion, in the same time and for the same cost as a  
Magic-User.  They may also research new potions, but  
at twice the cost in time and materials as a Magic-User.  
Review  the  rules  for  Magical  Research  starting  on 
page 191 for details.
Alternately,  a  Magic-User  seeking  to  create  certain 
magic items may employ an alchemist as an assistant.  
In this case, the alchemist adds 15% to the Magic-User's  
chance of success.
Animal  Trainer:  250  to  750  gp  per  month.  
Characters  wishing  to  ride  hippogriffs  or  employ  
carnivorous apes as guards will need the assistance of  
an animal  trainer.   The  lowest  cost  above  is for  an 
average  animal  trainer,  able  to  train  one  type  of 
"normal" animal such as carnivorous apes; those able to 
train  more  than  one  sort  of  animal,  or  to  train  
monstrous  creatures  such  as  hippogriffs,  are  more 
expensive to hire.  The Game Master must decide how  
long it takes to train an animal; in some cases, animal  
training  may  take  years,  a fact  the player characters 
may find inconvenient as well as expensive.  A single  
animal trainer can train and manage no more than 5  
animals at a time, though in most cases once an animal  
is fully trained, if it is put into service right away the  
animal trainer won't be needed to handle it any longer.
Armorer  (or  Weaponsmith):  100  to  500  gp  per 
month.  Characters  hiring  mercenaries,  or  having  
armed and armored followers to take care of, will need  
the services of an armorer.  In general, for every 50  
Fighters employed, one armorer is required to care for  
their gear.  The armorer's equipment is not included in  
the  costs  given  above,  but  the  cost  to  maintain  his 
apprentices is included; most such characters will have  
1d4 apprentices assisting.
Higher priced armorers or weaponsmiths may be hired  
to assist in making magic weapons or armor; in this  
case, the character hired will be a specialist, an expert in 
making one particular type of armor or weapon, and  
will command a higher price (as shown above).  Such  
characters will rarely agree to do the mundane work of  
maintaining weapons and armor for a military unit.
Engineer:  750 gp per month.   Any player character  
wishing  to  build  a  fortress,  a  ship,  or  any  other 
mundane construction will need an engineer.  Large  
projects  may  require  several  engineers,  at  the  GM's 
option.
Savant:  1,500 gp per month.   Savants are experts in  
ancient and obscure knowledge.  Many savants have  
particular interests in very limited or focused areas (for  
example, "Elven migrations of the 2 nd age"), but even  
these will know or have access to a lot of facts.  The  
listed cost is the minimum required to maintain a savant 
with his library, collections, etc.  If the savant's patron  
asks a difficult question, there may be additional costs  
for materials or research to answer it.
Ship's Crew:  Special.  A crew for a waterborne vessel  
involves several types of characters.  At the very least, a  
complement  of  sailors  and  a  Captain  are  needed; 
rowers will be needed aboard galleys, and a Navigator  
is required aboard ships going out of sight of land.
Costs per month for each sort of character are given  
below:
Seaman Type Cost
Captain 300 gp
Navigator 200 gp
Sailor 10 gp
Rower 3 gp
In general, all such characters are normal men, and are  
not  armored;  they  will  usually  be  armed  with  clubs, 
daggers,  or  shortswords.   Player  characters  with  
appropriate  backgrounds  may  act  as  Captain,  but 
unless experienced as a ship's captain, they will have  
difficulty commanding respect from the regular sailors  
(lower the Morale of such regular sailors by -2 if led by  
an inexperienced Captain).

ADVENTURE BASIC FANTASY RPG
Mercenaries
Mercenaries  are  hired  warriors.   They  are  generally 
hired in units as small as platoons:  32 to 48 Fighters,  
divided into two to four squads of soldiers; each squad  
is  led  by  a  corporal,  while  the  platoon  is  led  by  a 
lieutenant plus a sergeant.  Platoons are joined together  
into companies, each generally consisting of two to five  
platoons and led by a captain with a sergeant as his  
assistant (called a first sergeant).
As mercenaries are almost always veteran troops, the  
average  mercenary  is  a  1st  level  Fighter;  10%  of 
corporals  and  50%  of  sergeants  are  2nd  level.   A 
mercenary lieutenant will generally be 2nd level, while a 
captain will be 2nd to 4th level and his first sergeant will  
be 2nd or 3rd level.  Larger mercenary units will usually 
be  beyond  the  reach  of  player characters until  they 
have reached fairly high levels, and are left to the Game 
Master to detail.
Mercenaries will virtually never go into a dungeon, lair,  
or ruin, at least until it has been fully cleared.  Rather,  
they are used in outdoor military engagements; high  
level player characters may hire mercenaries to defend  
or help defend their castles or other holdings.
Mercenaries housed in a player character's stronghold  
require  200 square feet each but  cost 25% less per  
month, as this is covered by their room  and board.  
(Elven mercenaries, however, require 500 square feet  
of space  each  in order  to reduce their pay, as they  
demand better living conditions.)  See the Stronghold 
section on page 199 for more details.
Statistics are given below for the most common sorts of  
mercenaries; the statistics are for first level characters,  
and should be adjusted when higher level characters  
are indicated (as given above).  In particular, multiply  
the given cost of each mercenary by their level.  Listed  
costs are in gold pieces per month.

Character Advancement
Experience Points (XP)
Experience points are given for monsters defeated, and  
for other challenges as the GM sees fit.  The following  
table  provides  XP values  for  monsters.   Where  a  
monster has both a character level and hit dice given,  
use the larger value as the monster's level.  Non-combat 
challenges may be assigned a level, or a flat XP value  
assigned, as the GM wishes.
If asterisks appear after the hit dice listing for a monster,  
each asterisk adds the special ability bonus once; for  
example,  a  creature  with  a  hit  dice  figure  of  2**  is 
worth 125 XP.
For monsters with more than 25 hit dice, add 750 XP  
to the XP Value and 25 XP to the Special Ability Bonus  
per additional hit die.
NPCs should be treated as monsters of a number of hit  
dice equivalent to the character's level.  Add a special  
ability bonus for Clerics and Magic-Users if they are  
able to cast useful spells during the encounter.
After tallying the XP earned in a given adventure, the  
amount  should  be  divided  by  the  number  of  
adventurers.  As described above, each retainer should  
receive a one-half share; so a group with four player  
characters  and  a  retainer  is  counted  as  having  4½ 
members.  If 2,000 XP are earned by this group, one  
share is 444 XP, and the retainer receives 222 XP.
No character may advance more than one level due to  
the  experience  points  from  a single  adventure.   For 
example, Barthal the Thief is 1st level and has 1,000  
XP  before  going  on  an  adventure;  during  the  
adventure, he earns 2,000 more XP (an amazing feat).  
This would make his total 3,000 XP, and he would be a 
3rd  level  Thief.   This  is  not  allowed;  instead,  he  
advances  to  2,499  XP,  one  short  of  the  amount 
required for 3rd level, and starts his next adventure at  
2nd level.

ENCOUNTER BASIC FANTASY RPG
PART 5:  THE ENCOUNTER
I raised my shield to fend off one of the monsters, and hewed at another with my sword, but I missed my first  
swing.  Morningstar swung at one of the monsters and struck it, but her sword did the bony thing little harm.  I  
saw that Apoqulis still stood by the door; of Barthal there was no sign.  Fortunately, Apoqulis also had a torch.
Apoqulis raised his holy symbol and called in a loud voice, "In the name of Tah, begone!"  To my surprise,  
several of the monsters turned as if afraid and ran out the door, disappearing into the gloom.  Unfortunately this  
left quite a few of them still in the room.
Even as I saw all this I continued to hack at the monsters.  It took two good blows to down the first one; it  
appeared that Morningstar was having similar trouble with the monsters.  Then one of the skeletons hit her, just a  
minor wound, but still I felt good that I had invested my part of the proceeds of our last excursion in a suit of plate 
mail armor; I was shrugging off blows that would have harmed me were I still wearing chain mail.
To my surprise, I saw Apoqulis down one of the monsters in a single blow, then do the same to another in his  
very next strike.  His mace seemed to be much more effective against the monsters than our swords.  As I finally  
managed to down a second skeleton, I heard a high-pitched yell… it was Barthal, a little ways down the hallway,  
and he was throwing something.
There was a sound of glass breaking, and I felt a splash of water on my face.  Several of the skeletons began to  
smoke, and then one of them fell in a heap.  Holy water, I decided, but I didn't have time to think about it.  I just  
kept hacking at the skeletons.
By the time they were all gone, I had taken a wound, and Morningstar had taken a second.  We had one potion  
of healing left of those that Apoqulis' temple had given us; Morningstar told me to drink it, but I could tell she was  
in worse shape than I, so I insisted she take it.
Then we turned back to the sarcophagus…
Order of Play
When the party of adventurers comes in contact with  
potential  enemies,  time  shifts  to  combat  rounds  (10 
seconds  long,  as  described  previously).   Before  
beginning  combat,  surprise  is  checked  (see  below). 
Unsurprised characters then roll for Initiative, and act in 
order of the rolls (again, as described below).
Surprise
When surprise is possible, roll 1d6 for each side which  
might  be  surprised;  most  normal  characters  are  
surprised on a roll of 1-2.  Surprised characters are  
unable to act for one round.  Characters or creatures  
which  are  well  hidden  and  prepared  to  perform  an 
ambush  surprise  on  a  roll  of  1-4  on  1d6.   Some 
characters or creatures (such as Elves) are described as  
being less likely to be surprised; reduce the range by 1  
for such creatures.
For example:  Darion (a Human) and Morningstar (an  
Elf) open a door and come face-to-face with a party of  
goblins.  The GM rolls 1d6 for the goblins; on a 1-2  
they  are  all  surprised.   Then  the  GM  rolls  1d6  for 
Darion and Morningstar.  If the result is 1, both of them  
are surprised; if the roll is 2, only Darion is surprised.  If  
the roll is 3 or more, neither of them are surprised.
Surprised characters or creatures stand flat-footed for  
one round.  They still defend themselves, so there is no  
penalty  to  Armor  Class,  but  they  cannot  move  nor 
attack during the round of surprise.
Monster Reactions
When a group of player characters meet one or more  
monsters, it's important to know how the monsters will  
react to the party.  In many cases, the reaction of the  
monster or monsters is obvious… zombies guarding a  
tomb will virtually always attack intruders, for example.
In cases where the reaction of the monsters to the party  
is not  obvious,  a  reaction roll  may be made.  The  
Game Master rolls 2d6, adding the Charisma bonus of  
the  "lead"  character  (or  applying  their  Charisma  
penalty) along with any other adjustments they feel are  
reasonable, and consults the table below:
Reaction Roll Table
Adjusted Die Roll Result
2 or less Immediate Attack
3-7 Unfavorable
8-11 Favorable
12 or more Very Favorable
50

## Page 55

BASIC FANTASY RPG ENCOUNTER
A result of 2 or less means that the player characters  
have  so  offended  the  monsters  that  they  attack  
immediately.   An  Unfavorable  result  means  that  the 
monsters  do  not  like  the  player  characters,  and  will 
attack if they may reasonably do so.  A Favorable result  
simply means that the monsters will consider letting the  
player characters live if they choose to parley; it does  
not necessarily mean that the monsters like the player  
characters.  A Very Favorable result  means that the  
monsters (or perhaps only the monster leader) do, in  
fact, like the player characters; this does not mean that  
the monsters will just hand over their treasure, but it  
does indicate that they may choose to cooperate with  
the player characters in mutually beneficial ways.
As always, interpreting the results of this roll is left to the 
GM, who may choose to alter the result if they believe a 
different result would be more enjoyable to play out  
than the one rolled.
Initiative
Each combat round, 1d6 is rolled for Initiative for each  
character  or  monster.   This  roll  is  adjusted  by  the 
character's Dexterity  bonus.   High  numbers act first.  
Any  characters/monsters  with  equal  numbers  act  
simultaneously.   The  GM  may  make  single  rolls  for 
groups of identical monsters at their option.
As the GM counts down the Initiative numbers, each  
character  or  monster  may  act  on  their  number.   If 
desired, a combatant can choose to wait until a later  
number to act.  If a player states that they are waiting  
for  another  character  or  monster  to  act,  then  that 
character's  action  takes  place  on  the  same  Initiative 
number as the  creature  they  are  waiting  for,  and  is 
simultaneous just as if they rolled the same number.
A character using a weapon with a long reach (spears,  
for instance) may choose to attack a closing opponent  
on  the  closing  opponent's  number  and  thus  attack 
simultaneously with the opponent, even if the character  
rolled lower for Initiative.
Combat
Each  character  or  creature  involved  in  combat  may 
move,  if  desired,  up  to  its  encounter  movement  
distance, and then attack, if any opponent is in range,  
when its Initiative number comes up.  After attacking, a  
character or creature may not move again until the next  
round.
Opponents more than 5' apart may move freely, but  
once two opposing figures are within 5' of each other,  
they are "engaged" and must abide by the rules under  
Disengaging From Melee on page 52.
Running
Characters may choose to run; a running character is  
not  normally  allowed  to  attack  (but  see  Charging, 
below).  Running characters can move at double their  
normal  encounter  movement  rate.   Characters  are  
allowed to run a number of rounds equal to 2 times the  
character's Constitution, after which they are exhausted  
and may only walk (at the normal encounter rate).  For  
monsters  not  having  a  given  Constitution,  allow  the 
monster to run for 24 rounds.  Exhausted characters or  
creatures must rest for at least a turn before running  
again.
Maneuverability
The following rules may be considered optional.  They  
are hardly needed for most dungeon adventures, but  
will  add  measurably  to  combat  situations  in  the 
wilderness, especially in waterborne combat situations  
or when some or all combatants are flying.
Characters, creatures, and vehicles of various sorts have 
a turning distance.  This is given as a distance in feet in  
parentheses  after  their  movement  rate,  and  it  
determines how far they must move between facing  
changes when moving about in combat.
All  normal  player  characters,  and  in  fact  most  
moderately sized creatures which walk on the ground,  
have a turning distance of 5'.  If no turning distance is  
given for a creature, assume that it is 5'.
In general, a facing change is any turn of up to 90º (a  
right-angle turn); on a square-gridded map, this means  
turning to face directly to the right or left of the figure's  
current facing.  A half-turn (45º) still counts as a full  
facing change.  If using hexes, "diagonal" movement is  
51


## Page 56

ENCOUNTER BASIC FANTASY RPG
not available, so a facing change is the 60º turn to face  
toward the hex-side to the right or left of the current  
facing.
There are a few exceptions to this rule:
First, any creature that does not move away from its  
starting position during the combat round may make as  
many facing changes as desired (though circumstances,  
such  as  trying  to  turn  a  horse  around  in  a  narrow 
corridor, may prevent this).
Incorporeal flying creatures, such as spectres, can turn  
freely at any point while moving.
Creatures which are running (moving at double speed)  
may not make facing changes of more than 60º, and  
their turning  distance  increases by  10' (or,  if  it  is 5' 
normally, it increases to 10').
Also, most creatures can shift one space laterally while  
preserving their facing (this is called "sidestepping"), but  
this  may  only  be  done  when  moving  at  normal  
("walking") speed, not at fast ("running") speed.  "One  
space" means either 5' or 10', depending on the map or  
board being used.
Climbing and Diving
For battles involving three dimensions, each creature or  
vehicle  has  an  altitude (when  flying)  or  depth 
(underwater).  For air or sea battles, at least one of the  
creatures or vehicles should start at an altitude/depth of  
0, and a new 0 level can be established at any time, to  
simplify play, by adjusting the altitudes of each creature  
or vehicle.
A  winged  flier  can  gain  up  to  10'  of  altitude  after 
moving  forward  by  the  distance  shown  for  its  
maneuverability class, and can dive (lose altitude in a  
controlled fashion) at up to twice the normal movement 
rate; if the creature does not move horizontally by at  
least one-third its normal speed, it will stall, being forced 
to  dive  at  maximum  rate  for  one  round.   Floating 
creatures or vehicles (balloons, fly spell, flying carpets,  
etc.) can climb vertically without horizontal motion up  
to half the normal movement rate, but such "floaters"  
can only descend at the normal movement rate, unless  
they have lost the ability to float entirely.
Charging
Under some circumstances, characters or creatures may 
be allowed to attack at the end of a running move.  
This is called a  charge , and some specific limitations  
apply.  The charging character or creature must have  
moved at least 10 feet.  The movement must be in a  
more or less straight line toward the intended target,  
and the path to the target must be reasonably clear.  
Finally, the attacker must be using a weapon such as a  
spear, lance, or pole arm which is suitable for use while  
charging.   Certain  monsters,  especially  those  with  
horns, are able to use natural attacks when charging.  If 
the attacker does not have line of sight to an opponent,  
they can't charge that opponent.
The attack made after the charge is made at +2 on the  
attack roll.  The charging character or creature suffers a  
-2  penalty  to Armor  Class for  the  remainder  of  the 
round.  If the attack hits, it does double damage.
Set Weapon Against Charge:  Spears, pole arms, and 
certain  other  piercing  weapons  deal  double  damage 
when "set" (braced against the ground or floor) and  
used against a charging creature.  For this to be done,  
the  character  or  creature  being  charged  must  have 
equal  or  better  Initiative;  this  counts  as  holding  an 
action: both attacker and defender act on the attacker's  
Initiative number and are therefore simultaneous.
Disengaging From Melee
When  any  combatant  is  within  reach  of  the  melee 
attacks  of  at  least  one  enemy,  that  combatant  is 
considered to be  engaged.  Such a combatant may  
disengage in one of two ways:
First, the combatant may simply flee, turning away from 
all opponents they are engaged with and moving more  
than half normal movement.  All opponents with whom 
they are engaged are allowed a "parting shot" with a  
+2 bonus to attack, even if that opponent has already  
made all attacks for the round.  Opponents who have  
multiple melee attacks per round make just one; for  
instance, a tiger with the usual "2 claws, 1 bite" routine  
could only claw once or bite once.
To avoid the parting shot, the combatant may choose  
to  withdraw,  i.e.  back  away  by  up  to  half  normal 
movement.  After a withdrawal, the character may still  
attack  at  any  point  later  in  the  same  round  if  an 
opponent is within reach.
Evasion and Pursuit
Sometimes a  party  of  adventurers will  want  nothing 
more than to avoid a group of monsters (or sometimes,  
it's  the  monsters  avoiding  the  adventurers).   If  one 
group is surprised, and the other is not, the unsurprised  
group  may  be  able  to  escape  automatically  (unless 
something  prevents  them  from  making  an  exit).  
Otherwise, those wanting to evade the encounter begin  
doing so on their Initiative numbers.  Note that the rules 
above  for  Disengaging  From  Melee will  naturally  
apply to any combatant who is in reach of an enemy.

BASIC FANTASY RPG ENCOUNTER
The GM may easily play out the pursuit, following along 
on their map (note that the players can't draw maps  
while  they  run  headlong  through  the  dungeon  or 
wilderness  area).   Any  time  a  character  must  pass 
through a doorway, make a hard turn, etc., the GM  
may  require  a  saving  throw  vs.  Death  Ray  (with 
Dexterity  bonus  added);  if  the  save  is  failed,  the 
character has fallen at that point and moves no further  
that round; they may stand up and make a full move  
(but not a double move) on their Initiative number in  
the next round.
If the fleeing characters or creatures are ever able to get  
beyond the pursuer's sight for a full round, they have  
evaded pursuit… the pursuers have lost them.
How to Attack
To roll "to hit," the attacker rolls 1d20 and adds their  
attack  bonus  (AB),  as  shown  on  the  Attack  Bonus 
table, as well as Strength bonus (if performing a melee  
attack)  or  Dexterity  bonus  (if  performing  a  missile 
attack)  and  any  other  adjustments  required  by  the 
situation.  If the total is equal to or greater than the  
opponent's Armor Class, the attack hits and damage is  
rolled.  A natural "1" on the die roll is always a failure.  
A natural "20" is always a hit, if the opponent can be hit  
at all (for example, monsters that can only be hit by  
silver  or  magic  weapons  cannot  be  hit  by  normal 
weapons, so a natural "20" with a normal weapon will  
not hit such a monster).
Attacking From Behind
Attacks made from behind an opponent usually receive  
a +2 attack bonus.  This does not combine with the  
Sneak Attack ability (as described for the Thief on page  
9).
Normal Men
The NM entry in the table above is for  normal men , 
also known as zero level characters.  These characters 
represent the artisans, shopkeepers, scullery maids, and  
other non-adventurer characters who will appear in the  
game.  All such characters are NPCs, of course.  As  
mentioned elsewhere, it is up to the GM to determine if  
members  of  non-Human  character  races  have  zero 
level members of their own, and the exact statistics of  
such characters.
Average zero-level humans have 1d4 hit points, and  
usually are not proficient with any weapons except bare 
hands.   Green troops (those who have  not  been in  
battle yet) are zero-level, but have 1d6 hit points and  
are allowed to use any weapon allowed to a Fighter.
It is recommended not to waste time in detailing the  
ability score or other statistics of such characters further; 
they are normal, as in "average," and so very few would 
have extreme statistics.  A blacksmith might be credited  
with a Strength score of 13 or more, or a savant with  
Intelligence of 16 or more, but in general such things  
need not be detailed for most of these characters.

Monster Attack Bonus
When looking up a monster's hit dice on the Attack  
Bonus Table, ignore all "plus" or "minus" values; so a  
monster  with  3+2  hit  dice,  or  one  with  3-1,  is  still 
treated as just 3 hit dice.  The exception is monsters  
with 1-1 hit dice or less, which are considered as being  
less than one hit die and have an attack bonus of +0.
Melee Combat
Melee  occurs  when  a  character  closes  (approaches 
within the reach of their own weapon) and strikes at a  
foe.  Melee weapons or attacks may generally only be  
used against foes who are engaged with the attacker (as  
described above).
Missile Fire
Missile  weapons  may  be  used  to  attack  foes  at  a 
distance.  The distance the attacker is from his target  
affects the attack roll, as shown on the Missile Weapon  
Ranges table in the previous section on Characters.  In 
general, opponents within Short range are attacked at  
+1 on the die, those beyond Short range but within  
Medium range are attacked at +0, and those beyond  
Medium but within Long range are attacked at -2.  Foes 
beyond Long range cannot be effectively attacked.
If a character attempts to use a missile weapon against a 
foe who is within 5' of them (i.e. who is engaged with  
the shooter), a penalty of -5 is applied to the attack roll.  
This is due to the shooter dodging around to avoid the  
foe's attacks.  The only exception is if the attacker is  
behind  the  target  creature  and  undetected,  or  that 
creature is distracted so as to not be able to attack the  
shooter; in these cases, apply the usual +1 bonus (+3  
total bonus if attacking from behind).
Cover and Concealment
In certain situations, the intended target of a missile (or  
melee) attack may have cover or concealment of some  
kind. Cover is defined as "hard" protection such as that  
afforded by a thick tree trunk or stone wall, that is,  
anything  that  will  stop  or  slow  a  missile  weapon. 
Concealment is "soft" cover like fog or light foliage that  
makes the target difficult to see but does not affect the  
missile  itself.   Cover  or  concealment  makes  it  more 
difficult to strike an intended target, and thus a penalty  
will be applied to the attacker's die roll depending upon  
how much of the target is protected from attack.  For  
concealment the attack penalty should range from -1  
(25% obscured) to -4 (90% obscured).  For hard cover,  
these penalties should be doubled.
Missile Weapon Rate of Fire
In general, missile weapons are allowed a single attack  
per  round,  just  as  are  melee  weapons.   However, 
crossbows are an exception, as reloading a crossbow  
between shots is time-consuming.
A light crossbow can be fired once per two rounds, and  
the user may not perform any other actions (including  
movement)  during  the  "reloading"  round.   A  heavy 
crossbow can be fired just once per three rounds, again  
requiring the user to spend two rounds doing nothing  
other than cocking and loading the weapon in order to  
fire it again.
Siege  engines  also  fire  less  often  than  ordinary  
weapons.   The  rate  of  fire  for  such  a  weapon  is 
presented as a fraction, indicating the number of attacks 
per round; for example, 1/6 means one attack every six  
rounds.
Of course, the user of such a weapon may drop or sling  
the weapon and switch to another weapon rather than  
reloading.   Also,  it  is  possible  (especially  when  
defending a position) to load more than one crossbow  
in advance and then switch weapons each round until  
all have been fired.  In a dungeon environment this sort  
of strategy is unlikely, of course.
Grenade-Like Missiles
When throwing grenade-like missiles (flasks of oil, etc.),  
a successful attack roll indicates a direct hit.  Otherwise,  
the GM will roll 1d10 and consult the diagram below to  
determine where the missile hit.  Treat each number as  
representing a 10' square area.

BASIC FANTASY RPG ENCOUNTER
Missiles That Miss
With  the  exception  of  grenade-like  missiles,  missile 
weapons which miss the intended target are normally  
considered lost.  However, if the weapon is fired into a  
melee where allies of the shooter are involved, and the  
attack misses, it may hit one of the allied creatures.  The 
GM  should decide which allies may be hit, and roll  
attacks against each until a hit is made or all possible  
targets are exhausted.  These attack rolls are made with  
the  shooter's  normal  attack  bonus,  just  as  if  they 
intended to attack the allied creature.  However, the  
GM must make these rolls, not the player.
This rule is applied to attacks made by monsters, when  
appropriate.  However, the GM still makes the rolls.
This rule is intentionally vague; the GM must decide  
when and how to apply it based on the circumstances  
of the battle.  It is recommended that no more than  
three allies be "tried" in this way, but the GM may make 
an exception as they see fit.
Oil
A flask of oil can be used as a grenade-like missile.  The  
oil must be set afire in order to inflict damage; otherwise 
the  oil  is  just  slippery.   Assuming  some  means  of 
igniting the oil is at hand, a direct hit to a creature deals  
1d8 points of fire damage, plus in the next round the  
target takes an additional 1d8 points of damage, unless  
they spend the round extinguishing the flames by some  
reasonable means.  The GM must judge the method  
used; rolling on the floor (assuming it's not oily also) or  
covering  the  flames  with  a  wet  blanket  are  good 
methods, for instance, while pouring or splashing water  
on burning oil does little good.  In any event, a flask of  
burning oil only causes damage for two rounds at most.
If the oil is ignited by some sort of wick or fuse, then all  
other  creatures within  5 feet  of  the  point  of  impact 
receive 1d6 points of fire damage from the splash.  A  
save vs. Death Ray is allowed to avoid this damage.  If  
the flask does not hit the intended target (as described  
under Grenade-Like Missiles, above), then that creature 
may still take damage from the splash, and receives a  
saving throw.  No saving throw is allowed for a creature  
which has received a direct hit.
A flask of oil spilled or splattered on the ground will  
burn for 10 rounds.   Those  attempting to cross the  
burning oil will receive 1d6 points of fire damage each  
round they are in it (with no saving throw in this case).
Fire-resistant creatures, including creatures having fire-
based abilities, are not damaged by burning oil.
Holy Water
Holy water is harmful to undead creatures.  A character 
may  throw  a  flask  of  holy  water  as  a  grenade-like 
missile,  which  will  break  and  release  the  contents  if 
thrown against the body of a corporeal creature.  To  
use it against an incorporeal creature it must be opened  
and  poured  or  splashed  onto  the  target,  generally 
requiring the attacker to be directly adjacent to it.
Each  flask  of  holy  water  can  inflict  1d8  points  of 
damage to such a monster.  In addition, each additional  
undead monster within 5 feet of the point of impact  
receives 1d6 points of damage from the splash.  Holy  
water is only effective for one round.
Damage
If an attack hits, the attacker rolls damage as given for  
the weapon.  Melee attacks apply the Strength bonus or 
penalty  to  the  damage  dice,  as  do  thrown  missile 
weapons such as daggers or spears.  Usually, attacks  
with  bows  or  crossbows  do  not  gain  the  Strength 
bonus, but sling bullets or stones do.
Also, magic weapons will add their bonuses to damage  
(and cursed weapons will apply their penalty).  Note  
that,  regardless  of  any  penalties  to  damage,  any  
successful hit will do at least one point of damage.
As  creature  or  character  reduced  to  0  hit  points is  
generally  dead.   However,  note  optional  rules  may 
apply, as given on page 188 under Death and Dying.
Subduing Damage
Attacks made with the "flat of the blade" for non-lethal  
damage are made at a -4 attack penalty and do half  
damage.  Most weapons can be used this way; only  
those with penetration or slashing features on all sides  
cannot.
If a character is reduced to zero hit points who has  
taken at least some subduing  damage, and the total  
amount of normal (killing) damage the character has  
suffered is not equal to or greater than their total hit  
points, the character becomes unconscious rather than  
dying.   (Any  further  subduing  damage  is  then  
considered killing damage, allowing the possibility that  
someone  might  be  beaten  to  death.)   A  character 
knocked out in this way, but not subsequently killed,  
will wake up with 1 hit point in 1d4 turns, or can be  
awakened (with 1 hit point) by someone else after 2d10 
rounds.

ENCOUNTER BASIC FANTASY RPG
Brawling
Sometimes a character will attack without a weapon,  
striking  with  a  fist  or  foot.   This  is  called  brawling. 
Normal characters do 1d3 points of subduing damage  
with a punch, 1d4 with a kick; kicks are rolled at a -2  
attack  penalty.   A  character  in  no  armor  or  leather 
armor cannot successfully punch or kick a character in  
metal armor, and in fact, if this is attempted the damage 
is applied to the attacker instead of the defender.  The  
GM must decide which monsters can be successfully  
attacked this way.  All character classes may engage in  
brawling; there is no "weapon" restriction in this case.
Wrestling
A wrestling  attack requires a successful melee attack  
roll, where success indicates the attacker has grabbed  
their  opponent.   This  hold  is  maintained  until  the 
attacker releases it or the defender makes a save vs.  
Death Ray, which is attempted at the defender's next  
action (according to Initiative).  A successful wrestling  
attack  causes  the  attacker  to  move  into  the  same 
"space" as the defender (if miniature figures are used).
After achieving a hold on an opponent, the attacker can 
automatically inflict unarmed damage (as if striking with  
a fist),  prevent  a held opponent  from  speaking,  use 
simple magic items such as rings, or take any other  
action the GM allows.  The attacker may also attempt to 
acquire  an item  the  opponent  is holding  (such  as a 
weapon)  or  attempt  to  move  the  opponent  (as  
described below).  A held character may be voluntarily  
released whenever the attacker so desires.
The  attacker can’t  draw  or  use  a  weapon  or  use  a 
wand, staff, scroll or potion, escape another’s wrestling  
attack,  cast  a  spell,  or  pin  another  character  while 
holding an opponent.
Moving the Opponent:   The attacker can move up to  
one-half  speed  (bringing  the  defender  along)  with  a 
successful attack roll, if the attacker is strong enough to  
carry or drag the defender.
Acquiring an Object:   The attacker may attempt to  
take an item away from the defender.  This requires an  
additional attack roll; if the roll fails, the defender may  
immediately attempt an attack roll (even if they have  
already attacked this round) which, if successful, results  
in the defender pinning the attacker; or, the defender  
may choose to escape instead of reversing the hold.
Actions Allowed to the Defender:  The target of a  
successful hold is usually immobile (but not helpless) at  
least until their next action, as determined by Initiative.  
Such characters suffer a penalty of -4 to AC against  
opponents other than the attacker.
If  the  defender  is  significantly  stronger  and/or  larger 
than the attacker, they may move at up to one-half  
speed, dragging the attacker along.
On the defender's next action, they can try to escape  
the pin with a saving throw vs. Death Ray; the defender  
must  apply  the  better  of  their  Strength  or  Dexterity 
bonuses (or penalties) on this roll.  If the escape roll  
succeeds, the defender finishes the action by moving  
into any space adjacent to the attacker.
If more than one attacker has a hold on a particular  
defender, a successful escape roll frees the defender  
from just one of those attackers.
Held characters may also use simple magic items such  
as rings.  A character being held may not normally cast  
a spell, even if they  have not been silenced by the  
attacker.
Multiple  Opponents:   Several  combatants  can  be 
involved in a wrestling match.  Up to four combatants  
can wrestle a single opponent of normal size in a given  
round.   Creatures that are smaller than the  attacker  
count for half, while creatures that are larger count at  
least double (as determined by the GM).  Note that,  
after  an  opponent  is  pinned,  other  attackers  benefit 
from  the  -4  AC  penalty  applied  to  the  defender. 
However, this AC penalty is not  cumulative (that is,  
each successful attack does not lower the defender's AC 
further).
It is also possible for another character to attack the  
attacker in an ongoing wrestling bout.  In this case, a  
successful  hold  on  the  attacker  grants  the  original 
defender a +4 bonus on subsequent escape rolls.
Wrestling With Monsters:  In general, the rules above  
can be used not only when character races wrestle but  
also when humanoid monsters are involved.  The GM  
will decide whether or not to allow wrestling involving  
non-humanoid creatures on a case-by-case basis; if this  
is allowed, the following adjustments apply:
Creatures with extra grasping appendages (more than  
the usual two) gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls or saving  
throws  for  each  such  appendage.   This  includes  
creatures  with  feet  capable  of  grasping  (such  as  
monkeys or apes, giant spiders, etc.)
Large creatures able to fly may attempt to carry off their 
opponents (even if the flying creature is the defender).
56

## Page 61

BASIC FANTASY RPG ENCOUNTER
Wrestling attacks against creatures with touch attacks  
(such as wights) will cause the attacker to suffer one  
such attack automatically every round.
Morale
NPCs and monsters don't always fight to the death; in  
fact, most will try to avoid death whenever possible.  
Each  monster  listing  includes  the  monster's  Morale 
score, a figure between 2 and 12.  To make a Morale  
check, roll 2d6; if the roll is equal to or less than the  
Morale score, the monster or monsters are willing to  
stand and fight.  If the roll is higher, the monster has lost 
its nerve.  Monsters with a Morale score of 12 never fail  
a Morale check; they always fight to the death.
In  general,  Morale  is  checked  when  monster(s)  first 
encounter  opposition,  and  again  when  the  monster 
party is reduced to half strength (by numbers if more  
than one monster, or by hit points if the monster is  
alone).  For this purpose,  monsters incapacitated by  
sleep, charm, or hold magic are counted as if dead.
The  Game  Master  may  apply  adjustments  to  a  
monster's Morale score at their discretion.  Generally,  
adjustments should not total more than +2 or -2.  No  
adjustment is ever applied to a Morale score of 12.
A  monster  that  fails  a  Morale  check  will  generally 
attempt to flee; intelligent monsters or NPCs may try to  
surrender, if the GM so desires.
Note that special rules apply to retainers, as explained  
further on page 46.
Turning the Undead
Clerics  can  Turn  the  undead,  that  is,  drive  away 
undead monsters by means of faith alone.  The Cleric 
brandishes their holy symbol and calls upon the power  
of their divine patron.  The player rolls 1d20 and tells  
the GM the result.  Note that the player should always  
roll, even if the GM knows the character can't succeed  
(or can't fail), as telling the player whether or not to roll  
may reveal too much.
The GM looks up the Cleric's level on the Clerics vs.  
Undead table, and cross-references it with the undead  
type or Hit Dice.  (The Hit Dice row is provided for use  
with undead monsters not found in the Core Rules;  
only use the Hit Dice row if the specific type of undead  
monster is not on the table and no guidance is given in  
the monster's description.  Note that the hit dice given  
are  not  necessarily  the  same  as  the  hit  dice  of  the 
monster given for that column.)  If the table indicates  
"No"  for  that  combination,  it  is not  possible  for  the

Cleric to affect that type of undead monster.  If the  
table  gives  a  number,  that  is  the  minimum  number 
needed on 1d20 to Turn that type of undead.  If the  
table says "T" for that combination, that type of undead  
is automatically affected (no roll needed).  If the result  
shown  is  a  "D,"  then  that  type  of  undead  will  be 
Damaged (and possibly destroyed) rather than Turned.
If the roll is a success, 2d6 hit dice of undead monsters  
are affected; surplus hit dice are lost (so if zombies are  
being Turned and a roll of 7 is made, at most 3 zombies 
can be Turned), but a minimum of one creature will  
always be affected if the first roll succeeds.
If a mixed group of undead (say, a wight and a pair of  
zombies) is to be Turned, the player still rolls just once.  
The result is checked against the weakest sort first (the  
zombies), and if they are successfully Turned, the same  
result  is  checked  against  the  next  higher  type  of  
undead.   Likewise,  the  2d6  hit  dice  are  rolled  only 
once.  For example, if the group described above is to  
be Turned by a 2nd level Cleric, they would first need to 
have rolled a 15 or higher to Turn the zombies.  If this  
is a success, 2d6 are rolled; assuming the 2d6 roll is a 7, 
this would Turn both zombies and leave a remainder of  
3  hit  dice  of  effect.   Wights  are,  in  fact,  3  hit  die 
monsters, so assuming the original 1d20 roll was a 20,  
the wight is Turned as well.  Obviously, were it a group  
of 3 zombies and a wight, the 2d6 roll would have to be 
a total of 9 or higher to affect them all.
If a Cleric succeeds at Turning the undead, but not all  
undead monsters present  are  affected,  they  may  try 
again in the next round to affect those which remain.  If  
any roll to Turn the Undead fails, that Cleric may not  
attempt to Turn Undead again for one  full turn.  A  
partial failure (possible against a mixed group) counts as 
a failure for this purpose.
Undead monsters which are Turned flee from the Cleric 
and their party at maximum movement.  If the party  
pursue  and  corner  the  Turned  undead,  they  may 
resume  attacking  the  party;  but  if  left  alone,  the  
monsters will not return or attempt to attack the Cleric  
or those near them for at least 2d4 turns.
Undead  monsters  subject  to  a  D  (Damaged)  result 
suffer 1d8 damage per level of the Cleric (roll once and  
apply  the  same  damage  to  all  undead  monsters  
affected); those reduced to zero hit points are utterly  
destroyed,  being  blasted  into  little  more  than  dust. 
Those surviving this damage are still Turned as above.
Energy Drain
Sometimes characters are exposed to energy drain from 
undead or evil magic.  Such energy drain is manifested  
in the form of "negative levels."  For each negative level  
a victim receives, they suffer a semi-permanent loss of  
one hit die worth of hit points, a penalty of -1 on all  
attack and saving throw rolls (and any other roll made  
on 1d20), and -5% to any percentile roll such as thief  
abilities.   In  addition,  an  affected  spell  caster  loses 
access to one of their highest-level spell slots.   The  
victim may or may not be allowed a saving throw to  
resist  the  effect  (depending  on  the  specific  monster 
type).
If the character's hit points are reduced to zero or less  
by means of energy drain, the victim is immediately  
slain.   If  the  energy  drain  is  caused  by  an  undead 
monster, the victim will usually be transformed into that  
sort of undead (exact details vary by type of monster).
Negative levels may be removed by magic, such as the  
restoration spell .   When  a  negative  level  is  to  be 
removed, divide the total number of hit points lost by  
the number of negative levels (rounding normally) to  
determine how many hit points are restored.
For example, a character suffers three negative levels of  
energy drain.  The hit point losses rolled were 6, 5, and  
2, for a total of 13 points lost.  The first negative level  
removed restores 13 / 3 = 4.3333 hit points (which is  
rounded  to  4  even).   Now  the  character  has  two 
negative levels and has lost 9 hit points.  The next time  
a negative level is removed, the character recovers 9 / 2  
= 4.5 hit points, which is rounded to 5 even.  Now the  
character has one negative level and 4 hit points lost.  
Removal  of  the  last  negative  level  will  restore  the 
remaining 4 points.
