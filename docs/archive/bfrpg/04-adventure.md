SPELLS BASIC FANTASY RPG
Teleport Range: self
Magic-User 5 Duration: instantaneous
The  caster  of  this  spell  is  instantly  transported  to 
another  location  up  to 100  miles away  per  level  of 
ability.  The spell transports the caster only within their  
current  plane  of  existence.   Other  creatures  
(passengers)  and  inanimate  objects  (cargo)  may  be 
transported along with the caster, up to a maximum of  
300 pounds  plus 100 pounds per level above 10th.  
The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or  
creatures to be transported (although creatures to be  
transported may be in contact with one another, with at  
least one of those creatures in contact with the caster).  
Unwilling  creatures  are  allowed  a  saving  throw  vs. 
Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to  
make  an  attack  roll  to  make  contact  with  such  a 
creature.   Likewise,  a  successful  save  vs.  Spells will 
prevent  items  in  a  creature's  possession  from  being 
teleported.
The spell is directed by the mind of the caster, who  
must visualize the destination area; failure to visualize it  
properly can cause the spell to fail in a variety of ways,  
and destinations heavily saturated with magical energy  
(as defined by the Game Master) will cause the spell to  
fail automatically.
To  determine  the  results  of  this  spell,  choose  the 
appropriate column on the table below, then roll d%.
Knows
Well
Knows
Somewhat
Saw
Once Spell Result
01 01-02 01-03 Disaster
02 03-07 04-13 Wrong Place
03 08-13 14-25 Fell Short
04-00 14-00 26-00 Success!
Knows Well  applies when the caster has visited the  
destination  frequently  and/or  spent  a  substantial  
amount of time there; generally, the caster should have  
spent at least 7 days (not necessarily in a row) at the  
destination  within  the  last  year  to  qualify  for  this 
category.  Any place where the caster lived for more  
than a month in the last ten years, or more than a year  
in their life, also qualifies.
Knows Somewhat  applies when the caster has spent  
substantial time in the destination area, but not enough  
to qualify for Knows Well.  Alternately, the caster may  
have made an in-depth study of the area, looking at  
accurate drawings, maps, and floorplans or spending  
hours listening to descriptions from one or more people  
who Know Well the destination.
Saw Once applies when the caster has visited a place  
for as much as a day, but no more, or when the caster  
has  attempted  the  study  required  for  the  second  
definition of Knows Somewhat but has failed to acquire  
enough information (in the GM's opinion).
If the caster attempts to travel to a location that  
does not exist, or perhaps once existed but has been  
destroyed or otherwise changed so much that the caster 
would not recognize it, roll 2d20 instead d% for the  
result of the casting.  In this case, if Success! is rolled  
the  spell  simply  fails  and  no  one  is  transported  
anywhere.
Success! means  exactly  what  it  says.   The  caster,  
passengers, and cargo arrive safely exactly where the  
caster intended.
Fell Short  indicates that the caster, passengers, and  
cargo arrive safely 1d8x10% of the way to the intended  
destination.  Note that arriving "safely" does not mean  
that the destination is safe, but only the trip.
Wrong Place  means that the caster, passengers, and  
cargo arrive at some place that resembles the intended  
destination.  This means that the caster appears in the  
closest similar place within range, as decided by the  
GM.  If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the  
spell simply fails instead.
Disaster indicates  that  the  caster,  passengers,  and  
cargo  have  encountered  dimensional  turbulence  and 
have  crashed,  becoming  separated  (if  passengers  
and/or cargo accompanied the caster) and being injured 
in  the  process.   Each  creature  including  the  caster 
suffers 1d12 points of damage, and then rolls again on  
the same column using 2d20 instead of d%.  If another  
Disaster is rolled for any creature, apply another 1d12  
points of damage and roll once more.  Cargo objects  
are not normally damaged but the result must be rolled  
for each such item to determine where it has appeared;  
in  this  case,  if  Disaster  is  rolled  the  cargo  item  
disappears forever.
True Seeing Range: touch
Cleric 5 Duration: 1 round/level
This spell confers on the target the ability to see all  
things as they actually are. The subject sees through  
normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors, sees 
the exact  locations of  displaced creatures or objects,  
sees through normal or magical disguises, sees invisible  
creatures  or  objects  normally,  sees  through  illusions, 
and sees the  true  form  of  transformed,  changed,  or 
transmuted things.  The range of true seeing conferred  
is 120 feet.
True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects.  
It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent.  It  
does not negate concealment, including that caused by  
38

## Page 43

BASIC FANTASY RPG SPELLS
fog and the like.  In addition, the spell effects cannot be  
further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use  
true seeing  through  a  crystal ball  or in conjunction  
with clairvoyance.
Ventriloquism Range: 60'
Magic-User 1 Duration: 1 turn/level
This spell causes the caster's voice to appear to come  
from another location within range, for example, from a  
dark alcove or statue.  The caster may choose a new  
location each round if desired, and can cause the spell  
to temporarily abate without ending it and then resume  
it again at any time within the given duration.
Wall of Fire Range: 180'
Cleric 5, Magic-User 4 Duration: 1 round/level
(or special)
This spell creates a vertical sheet of flames in an area  
indicated by the caster, which is either a wall of flame  
up to 20' in length per caster level, or a ring with a  
radius up to 5' per caster level.  The caster may choose  
to make the wall smaller if desired.  The wall may be up 
to 20' tall (as desired by the caster and/or constrained  
by the ceiling).  The entire wall must lie within the range 
given above.  One or both sides of the wall may be hot,  
as  determined  by  the  caster  at  the  time  of  casting. 
Once created, the wall cannot be moved or changed.
Any creature within 20 feet of a hot side of the wall will  
suffer 1d4 points of damage each round, or 2d4 points  
if within 10 feet.  Damage is applied on the round the  
spell is cast and each round thereafter.  Actually passing  
through the wall causes 2d6 points of damage, plus 1  
per  caster  level,  even  if  the  side  the  character  or 
creature entered from was not a hot side.
Undead  creatures  are  particularly  susceptible  to  this 
spell, and suffer twice the damage described above.
If the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where  
creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing  
through  the  wall;  a  save  vs.  Spells  is  allowed,  with 
success  indicating  that  damage  is  rolled  as  if  the 
creature is within 10' of the wall.
The caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely  
(within  reasonable  limits  of  endurance)  by  
concentration, or may cast it with the standard duration  
of 1 round per level, at their option.
Wall of Iron Range: 90'
Magic-User 6 Duration: permanent
Using this spell the caster creates an iron wall.  The wall  
stands upright, and consists of up to one 10'x10' square  
section, one inch thick, per caster level.  The caster can  
increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate  
reduction  in  the  area;  for  example,  doubling  the  
thickness halves the area.  The caster may choose to  
make the wall smaller than the maximum size if desired. 
The wall may not be made less than one inch thick, and 
must always be created in contact with the ground or  
floor beneath it.  It is always a flat plate with no bends,  
but the edges do not have to be straight; indeed, the  
caster can cause the wall edge to mold itself around any 
obstructing  object  very  closely.   The  wall  cannot  
otherwise be created such that it occupies the space of  
any object or creature.
If the caster wishes, the wall edges will bond to any  
inanimate  materials  they  touch  (stone  walls,  soil,  
furnishings, and so on).  If this is not done, the wall may 
be unsupported (as determined by the GM based on  
the situation) and will thus likely fall.  If left unattended,  
there is an equal chance it will fall in either direction in  
1d6 rounds, but it can be pushed in a specific direction  
by any character having a minimum of Strength score  
of 13, or any monster with 4 or more hit dice.  Several  
creatures can work together to do so if desired.  (If the  
optional Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at  
-3 is sufficient to topple the wall.)
When the wall falls, any creatures it falls upon are likely  
to be injured or killed.  If it is possible for a character or  
creature  to  escape  the  area  (i.e.  it  has  sufficient  
movement rate and is not otherwise prevented from  
doing so), it is allowed to roll a save vs. Death Ray (with 
Dexterity bonus added).  If this save is successful, the  
creature or character moves by the most direct route to  
the nearest safe space; if the save fails or it is for some  
reason impossible to flee, 10d6 points of damage are  
inflicted on that victim.  Creatures larger than ogre-sized 
are  immune  to  being  crushed  and  will  simply  be 
knocked down if the save fails.
The wall is permanent, as indicated, but being made of  
iron is susceptible to rust and corrosion.

Wall of Stone Range: 15' per level
Magic-User 5 Duration: permanent
Using this spell the caster creates a stone wall.  The wall  
is composed of up to one 10'x10' square section, one  
foot thick, per caster level.  The caster can form this  
wall into almost any shape, with some restrictions.  The 
caster  can  increase  the  thickness  of  the  wall  with  a 
proportionate  reduction  in  the  area;  for  example,  
doubling the thickness halves the area.  The wall cannot 
be created such that it occupies the space of any object  
or  creature.   It  must  be  adequately  supported  by 
existing stone, which it will bond with automatically, but  
need  not  be  supported  over  its  entire  area.   For 
example, a wall of stone may be formed into a bridge  
over a stream or chasm, so long as both ends of the  
bridge rest solidly upon (and bond with) existing stone.
Bridges longer than 20 feet must be arched, buttressed,  
or  both  in  order  to  stand;  this  extra  construction 
reduces  the  wall's  usable  volume  by  half,  as  does 
creating  a  wall  with  battlements,  crenelations,  and 
similar basic structural elements.  No complex structural  
elements may be created by this spell.
Though made by magic, the wall is made of stone and  
can be broken or damaged just as if it were ordinary  
stone.
The  wall  can  be  formed  into  a  container  to  trap 
creatures, and if this is attempted the targets of the spell  
are  allowed  to  save  vs.  Death  Ray  to  avoid  being 
trapped.  If the save is successful the targets are able to  
make  up  to  one  full  move  to  a  space  outside  the 
container.
Water Breathing Range: touch
Magic-User 3 Duration: 2 hours/level
This spell grants living creatures touched by the caster  
(including the caster, if desired) the ability to breath in  
water as a fish does.  The duration may be divided  
evenly if the caster touches multiple targets one after  
another.   Affected  targets  do  not  lose  the  ability  to 
breathe air.
Web Range: 10' per level
Magic-User 2 Duration: 2 turns/level
This spell creates a volume of sticky strands resembling  
a spider's web but much larger and thicker.  The spell  
fills a volume of up to 8,000 cubic feet (equivalent to  
eight 10'x10'x10' cubes).   The webs must be attached  
to adjacent solid objects such as walls, pillars, and the  
like; any unsupported section of webbing collapses to  
the ground and disappears.  Within this limitation, the  
caster may choose any arrangement of webs they wish,  
up to the limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic foot  
volume.  The caster may choose to create a smaller  
volume if they wish.  
Creatures within the web at the time the spell is cast, as  
well as anyone entering the area afterward, will become  
entangled.  Each should roll a save vs. Death Ray, and  
any  creatures  who  succeed  at  this  save  may  move 
through  the  webbing  but  are  reduced  to  one-half 
normal movement rate.  Such creatures may not cast  
spells or perform normal attacks; whether other actions  
are  possible  is  left  to the  GM  to decide.   Once  an 
entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web,  
it will be able to act normally again.
Those  who  fail  the  save  are  fully  entangled  and  
trapped.  They cannot move, cast spells, or perform  
normal attacks or any other physical action.  Speech  
remains possible, however.  Creatures with Strength of  
13 or higher (or 4 or more hit dice) may be able to  
break loose, however; each round, such creatures are  
allowed  another  save  vs.  Death  Ray  with  results  as 
given  above.   Creatures  failing  the  initial  save  and 
having Strength of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice)  
are trapped until the duration expires or the webs are  
otherwise removed.
Attacks against an entangled creature by one outside  
the webbing will not normally entrap the attacker, so  
long as they do not need to venture into the web to  
reach the entangled target.
The web can be ignited; any application of fire to the  
webbing will cause a 10 foot cube to burn away in one  
round, with all 10 foot cubes adjacent to the destroyed  
one burning in the next round, and so on.  If any part  
of the web becomes unsupported it will collapse and  
disappear as noted above.
Creatures trapped within the burning web suffer 2d4  
points of damage when the cube they are trapped in  
burns, but they are thereafter completely free of the  
web.

BASIC FANTASY RPG SPELLS
Wizard Eye Range: 240'
Magic-User 4 Duration: 6 turns
With this spell the caster creates an invisible magical  
"eye"  through  which  they  can  see.   The  eye  has 
Darkvision with a range of 30 feet, but otherwise sees  
exactly as the caster would.  It can be created in any  
place the caster can see, up to a range of 240 feet  
away, and thereafter can move at a rate of 40 feet per  
round as directed by the caster.  The eye will not move  
more than 240 feet away from the caster under any  
circumstances.   The  eye  cannot  pass  through  solid 
objects, but as it is exactly the size of a normal human's  
eye, it can pass through holes as small as 1 inch in  
diameter.  The caster must concentrate to use the eye.
Wizard Lock Range: 20'
Magic-User 2 Duration: permanent
This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or  
shutter of wood, metal, or stone.  The magic affects the  
portal just as if it were securely closed and normally  
locked.  The effect lasts indefinitely.  Knock can be  
used to open the doorway without ending the spell, and 
dispel magic can be used to end it permanently .  The  
caster of this spell can easily open the door or other  
portal without ending the spell, as can a Magic-User  
three or more levels higher than the caster.
Word of Recall Range: self (special)
Cleric 6 Duration: instantaneous
With the utterance of a single word this spell transports  
the caster to a place of refuge which they designate  
when preparing the spell.  The place must be Known  
Well (as explained for teleport) to the caster to be so  
designated.   This  spell  cannot  transport  the  caster  
beyond their current plane of existence.
The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to  
exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above  
10th.  The caster must be in contact with all objects  
and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures  
to be transported may be in contact with one another,  
with at least one of those creatures in contact with the  
caster).
Unwilling creatures cannot be transported by this spell,  
nor can items in their possession.  If the caster or one of 
their passengers is holding an object that is also being  
held  by  an  unwilling  creature,  the  latter  can  retain 
possession  of  the  object  with  a  successful  save  vs. 
Spells.

ADVENTURE BASIC FANTASY RPG
PART 4:  THE ADVENTURE
Time and Scale
Time in the dungeon is measured in game turns (or just turns), which are approximately 10 minutes long.  When  
combat begins, the time scale changes to combat rounds, which are approximately 10 seconds long.  Thus, there  
are 60 combat rounds per game turn.  Approximately, because time is not meant to be kept exactly as it is  
subjective to the characters.
Distances in the dungeon are measured in feet.  Outdoors, change all distance measurements (movement, range,  
etc.) to yards (so 100 feet becomes 100 yards) but area of effect measurements (for spells, for instance) normally  
remain in feet.  Note that the single quote character is used as an abbreviation for feet in some places.
Dungeon Adventures
Carrying Capacity
Normal Human, Elven, and Dwarvish player characters  
are  able  to  carry  up  to  60  pounds  and  still  be  
considered lightly loaded, or up to 150 pounds and be  
considered heavily loaded.  Halflings may carry up to  
50 pounds and be considered lightly loaded, or up to  
100 pounds and be heavily loaded.  Note that armor  
for Halfling characters is about one-quarter as heavy as  
armor for the other races.
These  figures  are  affected  by  Strength;  each  +1  of 
Strength  bonus  adds  10%  to  the  capacity  of  the 
character, while each -1 deducts 20%.  Thus, carrying  
capacities for normal characters are as shown below  
(rounded to the nearest 5 pounds for convenience):
Dwarf, Elf, Human Halfling
STR Light Load Heavy Load Light Load Heavy Load
3 25 60 20 40
4-5 35 90 30 60
6-8 50 120 40 80
9-12 60 150 50 100
13-15 65 165 55 110
16-17 70 180 60 120
18 80 195 65 130
The carrying capacities of various domesticated animals  
are given in the Monsters section, in the entry for each  
type of animal.
Movement and Encumbrance
The  movement  rate of  a  character  or  creature  is  
expressed  as  the  number  of  feet  it  can  move  per 
combat round.  The normal player character races can  
all move 40' per round.  When exploring a dungeon,  
time is expressed in turns, as explained above; normal  
movement per turn is 3 times the movement rate per  
round.
This  may  seem  slow,  but  this  rate  of  movement 
includes such things as drawing maps, watching out for  
traps and monsters (though they may still surprise the  
party), etc.  In a combat situation, on the other hand,  
everyone is moving around swiftly, and such things as  
drawing maps are not important.
A  character's  movement  rate  is  adjusted  by  their  
Encumbrance (the load they are carrying) as follows:
Armor Type
Lightly 
Loaded
Heavily 
Loaded
No Armor or Magic Leather 40' 30'
Leather Armor or Magic Metal 30' 20'
Metal Armor 20' 10'
Count  the  weight  of  armor  worn  when  calculating 
encumbrance, because armor counts both for bulk and  
restrictiveness  as  well  as  for  weight.   Magic  armor 
counts  for  its  full  weight  but  is  not  as  bulky  and 
restrictive as normal armor, thus granting an improved  
movement rate.
For  animals  such  as  horses,  being  heavily  loaded 
reduces movement rate as shown below:
Normal Mv Heavy Load Normal Mv Heavy Load
10' 5' 130' 100'
20' 10' 140' 110'
30' 20' 150' 120'
40' 30' 160' 130'
50'-60' 40' 170'-180' 140'
70' 50' 190' 150'
80' 60' 200' 160'
90' 70' 210' 170'
100' 80' 220' 180'
110'-120' 90' 230'-240' 190'

BASIC FANTASY RPG ADVENTURE
Mapping
In any dungeon expedition, making maps is important.  
Generally one player will do this, drawing a map on  
graph paper as the Game Master describes each room  
or corridor.  Absolute accuracy is usually not possible;  
the main thing is to ensure that the party can find its  
way back out of the dungeon.
Light
A  torch  or  lantern  will  provide  light  covering  a  30' 
radius; dim light will extend about 20' further.  Normal  
torches burn for 1d4+4 turns, while a flask of oil in a  
lantern will burn for 1d6+18 turns.  A candle will shed  
light over a 5' radius, with dim light extending 5' further.  
In  general,  taper  candles  such  as  are  used  for  
illumination will burn about 3 turns per inch of height.
Darkvision
Some character races as well as almost all monsters  
have Darkvision, an ability which allows them to see  
even in total darkness.  Such vision is in black and  
white,  but  otherwise  like  normal  sight.   Magical  
darkness  obstructs Darkvision  just  as  it  does  normal 
vision.  The range of Darkvision is typically either 30' or  
60'; if not given for a particular creature, assume the 60'  
range.
Darkvision is totally ineffective in any light greater than  
moonlight.
Doors
A stuck door can be opened on a roll of 1 on 1d6; add  
the character's Strength bonus to the range, so that a  
character with a bonus of +2 can open a stuck door on  
a roll of 1-3 on 1d6.
Locked doors can be forced by rolling the same range,  
but on 1d10.  Metal bars can sometimes be bent on a  
roll of this range on 1d20.
A careful character might choose to listen at a door  
before opening it.  Thieves have a special ability, Listen, 
which should be applied if the listener is a Thief.  For  
other characters, the GM rolls 1d6, with 1 indicating  
success.  Sounds heard might include voices, footsteps,  
or any other sound the GM considers appropriate.  Of  
course,  the  room  beyond  the  door  might  really  be 
silent; thus, the Game Master must make the roll, so  
that a roll of 1 in such a case will not give anything  
away to the players.
Traps
Dungeons and ruins frequently contain traps, including  
spear-throwers, covered pits, etc.  The GM will decide  
what is required to trigger a trap, and what happens  
when the trap is triggered.  (Some guidance on this is  
provided in the Game Master section later in this book.) 
In general, there will be some way to avoid or reduce  
the effect of the trap being sprung.  For instance, a save  
vs.  Death  Ray  is  often  used  to  avoid  falling  into  a 
covered pit (with Dexterity bonus added), while spear-
throwers,  automated  crossbows,  and  the  like  are  
sometimes treated as if they were monsters (attacking  
vs.  the  victim's  Armor  Class  at  some  given  attack 
bonus).
Normal characters have a chance equal to a roll of 1 on  
1d6 to detect a trap if a search for one is made.  Note  
that  this  is  about  a  16.7%  chance;  Thieves have  a  
special  ability  to  find  and  remove  traps,  which  
supersedes this roll, as does the stonework trap-finding  
ability of Dwarves.  A Dwarven Thief is a special case;  
apply whichever trap-detection ability is higher.  In all  
cases, a search for traps takes at least a turn per 10'  
square area.  A single character may only effectively  
search a given area for traps once, even if the character  
has more than one trap-detection roll "type" allowed  
(such as the Dwarven Thief above).
Trap detection may not be allowed if the trap is purely  
magical in nature; on the other hand, in such cases  
Magic-Users  and/or  Clerics  may  be  able  to  detect 
magical traps at the given 1 in 1d6 chance, at the Game 
Master's option.  Note also the 2 nd level Clerical spell  
find traps, available to 4th level and higher Clerics.
43


## Page 48

ADVENTURE BASIC FANTASY RPG
Secret Doors
Under  normal  conditions,  searching  for  secret  doors 
takes one turn per character per 10' of wall searched.  A 
secret door is found on a roll of 1 on 1d6; characters  
with 15 or higher Intelligence succeed on a roll of 1-2.  
Also, as noted previously, Elves add 1 to the range  
automatically, such that an Elf discovers secret doors on 
a 1-2 on 1d6, or 1-3 if the Elf has an Intelligence of 15  
or higher.  The GM may create secret doors that are  
more difficult (or easier) to detect at their option.
Multiple characters searching for secret doors ensures  
that any such will eventually be found; however, if the  
first and second searchers fail, the next searcher must  
take two turns to search, and all subsequent searches of 
the area require an hour.
Note  that  finding  a  secret  door  does  not  grant  
understanding of how it works.  The GM may require  
additional rolls or other actions to be taken before the  
door can be opened.
Dungeon Survival
As  described  previously  in  the  Equipment section,  
normal characters must consume one day's worth of  
rations (or equivalent food) and at least one quart of  
water per day.
Failure to consume enough food does not significantly  
affect a character for the first two days, after which they  
suffer 1 point of damage per day.  Furthermore, at that  
point  the  character  loses  the  ability  to  heal  wounds 
normally, though magic will still work.  Eating enough  
food for a day (over the course of about a day, not all  
at once) restores the ability to heal, and the character  
will resume recovering lost hit points at the normal rate.
Inadequate water affects characters more swiftly; after a  
single day without adequate water, the character loses  
1d4 hit points, and will lose an additional 1d4 hit points  
per day thereafter.  Healing ability is lost when the first  
die of damage is rolled.

Wilderness Adventures
Wilderness Movement Rates
The  table  below  shows  wilderness  travel  rates  for 
characters or creatures based on encounter movement. 
Naturally, any group traveling together moves at the  
rate of the slowest member.
Normal Mv Miles/Day Normal Mv Miles/Day
10' 6 70' 42
20' 12 80' 48
30' 18 90' 54
40' 24 100' 60
50' 30 110' 66
60' 36 120' 72
Overland Travel
The movement rates shown on the table  above are  
figured based on an 8 hour day of travel through open,  
clear  terrain.   The  terrain  type  will  alter  the  rate  
somewhat, as shown on this table:
Terrain Adjustment
Jungle, Mountains, Swamp x1/3
Desert, Forest, Hills x2/3
Clear, Plains, Trail x1
Road (Paved) x1 1/3
Characters  may  choose  to  perform  a  forced march , 
traveling  12  hours  per  day  and  adding  50%  to  the 
distance traveled.  Each day of forced march after the  
first inflicts 1d6 points of damage on the characters (and 
their animals, if any).  A daily save vs. Death Ray with  
Constitution  bonus  applied  is  allowed  to  avoid  this 
damage, but after this save is failed once, it is not rolled  
again for that character or creature.  A day spent resting  
"restarts" this progression.
Becoming Lost
Though  adventurers  following  roads,  rivers,  or  other 
obvious landmarks are unlikely to become lost, striking  
out into trackless forest, windblown desert, and so on is  
another matter.  Secretly roll a save vs. Death Ray,  
adjusted  by  the  Wisdom  of  the  party  leader  (i.e., 
whichever character seems to be leading).  An Ability  
Roll against Wisdom may be rolled, if that optional rule  
is in use.  The GM must determine the effects of failure.
Waterborne Travel
Travel by water may be done in a variety of boats or  
ships;  see  Vehicles on  page  13 for  details.   Travel  
distances are for a 12 hour day of travel, rather than the 
usual 8 hours per day.  Sailing ships may travel 24  
hours per day if a qualified navigator is aboard, and so  
may be able to cover twice the normal distance per day  
of travel.   This is in addition  to the  multiplier given  
below.  If the ship stops each night, as is done by some  
vessels  traveling  along  a  coastline  as  well  as  those 
having less than the minimum number of regular crew  
on board, the two-times multiplier does not apply.
Movement of sailing ships is affected by the weather, as  
shown  below.   Sailing movement  modifiers  apply  
when  sailing  with  the  wind;  sailing  against  the  wind 
involves  tacking (called  "zigzagging"  by  landlubbers) 
which reduces movement rates as indicated.
d12 Wind Direction
1 Northerly
2 Northeasterly
3 Easterly
4 Southeasterly
5 Southerly
6 Southwesterly
7 Westerly
8 Northwesterly
9-12 Prevailing wind direction for this locale
d% Wind Conditions Sailing Tacking
01-05 Becalmed x0 x0
06-13 Very Light Breeze x1/3 x0
14-25 Light Breeze x1/2 x1/3
26-40 Moderate Breeze x2/3 x1/3
41-70 Average Winds x1 x1/2
71-85 Strong Winds x1 1/3 x2/3
86-96 Very Strong Winds x1 1/2 x0
97-00 Gale x2 x0
Becalmed:  Sailing ships cannot move.  Oared ships may  
move at the given rowing movement rate.
Very Strong Winds:  Sailing against the wind (tacking) is not  
possible.
Gale:  Sailing  against  the  wind  is  not possible,  and ships 
exposed to a gale may be damaged or sunk; apply 2d8 points  
of damage to any such ship, per hour sailed.
Traveling by Air
When traveling by air, overland movement rates are  
doubled,  and  all  terrain  effects  are  ignored.   Most 
winged  creatures  must  maintain  at  least  one-third  
normal forward movement in order to remain airborne;  
however, devices such as  flying carpets  generally do  
not have this limitation.

ADVENTURE BASIC FANTASY RPG
Retainers, Specialists and Mercenaries
Player characters will sometimes want or need to hire  
NPCs  (Non-Player  Characters)  to  work  for  them.  
There are several categories of NPCs available for hire,  
as follows:
Retainers
A  retainer  is  a  close  associate  of  his  employer.  
Retainers are hired for a share of treasure (typically at  
least 15% of the employer's income) plus support costs  
(weapons,  armor,  rations,  and  basic  equipment  
provided by the employer).  Retainers are typically very  
loyal  and  are  willing  to  take  reasonable  risks;  in  
particular, they are the only sort of hireling who will  
generally  accompany  a  player  character  into  a  
dungeon, lair, or ruin.
Hiring  a  retainer  is  more  involved  than  hiring  other 
NPCs.  First, the player character must advertise for a  
retainer, typically by hiring a crier, posting notices in  
public  places,  or asking  (and  possibly  paying)  NPCs 
such  as  innkeepers  or  taverners  to  direct  potential 
retainers to the player character.  It is up to the Game  
Master  to  rule  on  what  must  be  done,  and  how 
successful these activities are.
If the player character is successful, one or more NPCs  
will present themselves to be interviewed.  The Game  
Master should play out the interview with the player,  
and after all offers have been made and all questions  
asked, a reaction roll should be made.  To check the  
potential retainer's reaction, the Game Master rolls 2d6  
and adds the player character's  Charisma bonus.  In  
addition, the Game Master may apply any adjustments  
they feel are appropriate (a bonus of +1 for higher-
than-average pay or the offer of a magic item such as a  
Sword +1 , or a penalty if the player character offers  
poor terms).  The roll is read as follows:
Adjusted Die Roll Result
2 or less Refusal, -1 on further rolls
3-5 Refusal
6-8 Try again
9-11 Acceptance
12 or more Acceptance, +1 to Loyalty
Refusal,  -1  on  further  rolls means  that  all  further 
reaction rolls made toward that player character in the  
given town or region will be at a penalty of -1 due to  
unkind words said by the NPC to his fellows.  If the  
player  character  tries  again  in  a  different  town,  the 
penalty does not apply.
If a  Try again result is rolled, the potential retainer is  
reluctant,  and  needs  more  convincing;  the  player  
character must "sweeten" the deal in order to get an  
additional roll, such as by offering more pay, a magic  
item, etc.  If the player character makes no better offer,  
treat Try again as a Refusal result.
Loyalty:  All retainers have a Loyalty score, which is  
generally  7  plus  the  employer's  Charisma  bonus  (or 
penalty).  The Loyalty score is used just as the Morale 
score of monsters or mercenaries is used.  
If a Loyalty check roll made in combat is a natural 2,  
the Loyalty of the retainer increases by +1 point.  Note  
that a Loyalty of 12 is fanatical… the retainer will do  
virtually anything the player character asks, and never  
flees in combat.  However, the Game Master should still 
apply penalties when the player character instructs the  
retainer  to  do  something  which  appears  very  risky, 
making a failed check possible.
In  addition,  the  Game  Master  should  roll  a  Loyalty 
check for each retainer at the end of each adventure,  
after treasure is divided, to determine if the retainer will  
remain with the player character.  The GM may apply  
adjustments to this roll,  probably no more  than two  
points plus or minus, if the retainer is particularly well or 
poorly paid.
Maximum Number of Retainers:   A player character  
may hire at most 4 retainers, adjusted by the character's 
Charisma bonus or penalty.  Any attempts to hire more  
than this number of retainers will be met with automatic 
refusals.
Level of Retainers:   Normally, potential retainers will  
be one-half the level of the employer (or less).  So, a  
first level character cannot hire retainers, second level  
PCs can only hire first level characters, and so on.  Of  
course,  there  is  no  way  for  the  retainers  to  directly 
know  the  level  of  the  PC  employer,  nor  for  the 
employer to know the level of the potential retainer; but 
the Game Master should usually enforce this rule for  
purposes of game balance.  It shouldn't be surprising  
that  first  level characters can't  hire  retainers,  as they 
have no reputation to speak of yet.
Experience for Retainers:   Unlike other hired NPCs,  
retainers do gain experience just as other adventurers  
do;  however,  as they  are  under  the  command  of  a 
player  character,  only  one-half  of  a  share  of  XP is  
allocated  to  each  retainer.   See  Character 
Advancement, below, for an example.
