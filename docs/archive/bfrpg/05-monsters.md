Cleric to affect that type of undead monster.  If the  
table  gives  a  number,  that  is  the  minimum  number 
needed on 1d20 to Turn that type of undead.  If the  
table says "T" for that combination, that type of undead  
is automatically affected (no roll needed).  If the result  
shown  is  a  "D,"  then  that  type  of  undead  will  be 
Damaged (and possibly destroyed) rather than Turned.
If the roll is a success, 2d6 hit dice of undead monsters  
are affected; surplus hit dice are lost (so if zombies are  
being Turned and a roll of 7 is made, at most 3 zombies 
can be Turned), but a minimum of one creature will  
always be affected if the first roll succeeds.
If a mixed group of undead (say, a wight and a pair of  
zombies) is to be Turned, the player still rolls just once.  
The result is checked against the weakest sort first (the  
zombies), and if they are successfully Turned, the same  
result  is  checked  against  the  next  higher  type  of  
undead.   Likewise,  the  2d6  hit  dice  are  rolled  only 
once.  For example, if the group described above is to  
be Turned by a 2nd level Cleric, they would first need to 
have rolled a 15 or higher to Turn the zombies.  If this  
is a success, 2d6 are rolled; assuming the 2d6 roll is a 7, 
this would Turn both zombies and leave a remainder of  
3  hit  dice  of  effect.   Wights  are,  in  fact,  3  hit  die 
monsters, so assuming the original 1d20 roll was a 20,  
the wight is Turned as well.  Obviously, were it a group  
of 3 zombies and a wight, the 2d6 roll would have to be 
a total of 9 or higher to affect them all.
If a Cleric succeeds at Turning the undead, but not all  
undead monsters present  are  affected,  they  may  try 
again in the next round to affect those which remain.  If  
any roll to Turn the Undead fails, that Cleric may not  
attempt to Turn Undead again for one  full turn.  A  
partial failure (possible against a mixed group) counts as 
a failure for this purpose.
Undead monsters which are Turned flee from the Cleric 
and their party at maximum movement.  If the party  
pursue  and  corner  the  Turned  undead,  they  may 
resume  attacking  the  party;  but  if  left  alone,  the  
monsters will not return or attempt to attack the Cleric  
or those near them for at least 2d4 turns.
Undead  monsters  subject  to  a  D  (Damaged)  result 
suffer 1d8 damage per level of the Cleric (roll once and  
apply  the  same  damage  to  all  undead  monsters  
affected); those reduced to zero hit points are utterly  
destroyed,  being  blasted  into  little  more  than  dust. 
Those surviving this damage are still Turned as above.
Energy Drain
Sometimes characters are exposed to energy drain from 
undead or evil magic.  Such energy drain is manifested  
in the form of "negative levels."  For each negative level  
a victim receives, they suffer a semi-permanent loss of  
one hit die worth of hit points, a penalty of -1 on all  
attack and saving throw rolls (and any other roll made  
on 1d20), and -5% to any percentile roll such as thief  
abilities.   In  addition,  an  affected  spell  caster  loses 
access to one of their highest-level spell slots.   The  
victim may or may not be allowed a saving throw to  
resist  the  effect  (depending  on  the  specific  monster 
type).
If the character's hit points are reduced to zero or less  
by means of energy drain, the victim is immediately  
slain.   If  the  energy  drain  is  caused  by  an  undead 
monster, the victim will usually be transformed into that  
sort of undead (exact details vary by type of monster).
Negative levels may be removed by magic, such as the  
restoration spell .   When  a  negative  level  is  to  be 
removed, divide the total number of hit points lost by  
the number of negative levels (rounding normally) to  
determine how many hit points are restored.
For example, a character suffers three negative levels of  
energy drain.  The hit point losses rolled were 6, 5, and  
2, for a total of 13 points lost.  The first negative level  
removed restores 13 / 3 = 4.3333 hit points (which is  
rounded  to  4  even).   Now  the  character  has  two 
negative levels and has lost 9 hit points.  The next time  
a negative level is removed, the character recovers 9 / 2  
= 4.5 hit points, which is rounded to 5 even.  Now the  
character has one negative level and 4 hit points lost.  
Removal  of  the  last  negative  level  will  restore  the 
remaining 4 points.

BASIC FANTASY RPG ENCOUNTER
Those who have suffered energy drain generally have a  
gaunt,  haggard  look  about  them,  noticeable  by  
observant characters.
Healing and Rest
Characters recover 1 hit point of damage every day,  
provided that normal sleep is possible.  Characters who  
choose full bedrest regain an additional hit point each  
evening.
Normal characters require 6 hours sleep out of every  
24.  Subtract from this number of hours the character's  
Constitution bonus; so a character with 18 Constitution  
needs only 3 hours sleep per night (and a character  
with 3 Constitution needs 9 hours).  Note that these  
figures are minimums; given a choice, most characters  
would prefer to sleep two or more hours longer.
Characters who get less than the required amount of  
sleep suffer a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and saving  
throws  (as  well  as  not  receiving  any  hit  points of  
healing).   For  each  additional  night  where  sufficient 
sleep is not received, the penalty becomes one point  
worse.  Regardless of how long the character has gone  
without adequate sleep, the normal amount of sleep  
will remove these penalties.
Constitution Point Losses
Any  character  who  has  lost  Constitution  points  
temporarily (such as due to a disease) may regain them  
with normal rest.  The rate of recovery is one point per  
day,  awarded  each  morning  when  the  character  
awakens from a normal night's sleep.  If more than one  
Constitution point was lost, the character must make a  
save vs. Death Ray (without adjustments) to regain the  
final point; failure results in a permanent loss of that  
point.
If  a  Constitution  loss  results  in  a  lower  bonus  or 
penalty, the character's maximum hit points must be  
reduced  appropriately;  for  instance,  a  character  
reduced from 16 to 15 Constitution goes from +2 to  
+1,  thus  losing  one  hit  point  per  die  rolled.  If  a 
reduction in maximum hit points reduces that figure to  
less than the character's current hit points, reduce the  
current hit points to the new maximum hit point figure  
immediately.
When  regaining  Constitution,  any  increase  that  
increases the character's Constitution bonus results in  
the  restoration  of  the  hit  points  lost  due  to  the  
reduction, added to the maximum hit point figure only.  
Current hit points will not be improved in this fashion,  
but rather must be regained by normal healing.
Falling Damage
Characters suffer 1d6 points of damage per 10' fallen,  
up  to  a  maximum  20d6.   Fractional  distances  are 
rounded to the nearest whole number, so that a fall of  
1-4' does no damage, 5'-14' does 1d6, etc.
Deafness and Blindness
A deafened creature can react only to what it can see or 
feel,  is  surprised  on  1-3  on  1d6,  and  suffers  a  -1 
penalty  to  its  Initiative  rolls.   A  blinded  creature  is 
surprised on 1-4 on 1d6,  suffers a -4 penalty  to its  
attack rolls, a -4 penalty to its  Armor Class , and a -2  
penalty to its Initiative rolls.  These effects are modified  
when  dealing  with  monsters  having  unusual  sensory 
abilities; for example, bats may be affected by deafness  
as if blinded instead.
These penalties are for characters or creatures recently  
handicapped.  Those who are normally blind or deaf  
may have reduced penalties at the GM's option.
Note  that  the  penalty  for  attacking  an  invisible  
opponent is the same as the penalty for attacking blind,  
that is, -4 on the attack roll.  Do not apply this twice... a  
blind character attacking an invisible opponent  is no  
worse off than if they were attacking a visible one.

ENCOUNTER BASIC FANTASY RPG
Attacking a Vehicle
Attacks against vehicles (such as wagons or ships) are  
made against Armor Class 11.  Each vehicle has listed  
Hardness and Hit Point values.  Roll damage against  
the  vehicle,  and  then  reduce  that  damage  by  the 
Hardness value.  Any excess damage is applied to the  
vehicle.
If the vehicle takes damage equal to or greater than the  
listed HP on one side, it is reduced to half speed due to  
wheel damage or a hull breach; if it takes this much  
again, it is immobilized, and this much damage will sink  
a ship.
Repairing a Vehicle
Damage done to a vehicle may be restored at a rate of  
1d4 hit  points per crew member per hour of  labor.  
However, a vehicle can only be restored to 90% of its  
maximum hit points by field repairs; a damaged ship  
must be put into drydock and repaired by a shipwright  
and his crew, while a wagon, cart or chariot will require  
a wagonmaker to repair them.  Costs of such repairs  
are left to the Game Master to decide.
Saving Throws
Saving throws  represent the ability of a character or  
creature to resist or avoid special attacks, such as spells  
or poisons.  Saving throws are made by rolling a d20  
against a target number based on the character's class  
and level; for monsters, a comparable class and level  
are  provided  for  the  purpose  of  determining  the  
monster's saving throw figures.  As with attack rolls, a  
natural (unadjusted) roll of 20 is always a success, and  
a natural 1 is always a failure.
The five categories of saving throw as follows:  Death 
Ray or Poison ,  Magic Wands ,  Paralysis or Petrify , 
Dragon  Breath,  and  Spells.   Spells  and  monster  
special  attacks  will  indicate  which  category  applies 
(when a saving throw is allowed), but in some unusual  
situations  the  Game  Master  will  need  to  choose  a 
category.  One way to make this choice is to interpret  
the  categories  metaphorically.   For  example,  a  GM 
might be writing an adventure wherein there is a trap  
that  pours  burning  oil  on  the  hapless  adventurers. 
Avoiding the oil might be considered similar to avoiding  
Dragon Breath.  Or perhaps a stone idol shoots beams  
of energy from its glaring eyes when approached.  This  
attack may be considered similar to a Magic Wand, or if  
especially potent, a Spell.  The saving throw vs. Death  
Ray is often used as a "catch all" save versus many of  
the  "ordinary"  dangers  encountered  in  a  dungeon 
environment.
In general, saving throw rolls are not adjusted by ability  
score  bonus  or  penalty  figures.   There  are  a  few 
exceptions: 
• Poison saving throws are adjusted by the 
character's Constitution modifier.
• Saving throws against illusions (such as 
phantasmal force) are adjusted by the 
character's Intelligence modifier.
• Saving throws against charm spells (and other 
forms of mind control) are adjusted by the 
character's Wisdom modifier.
The GM may decide on other saving throw adjustments 
as they see fit.
Item Saving Throws
Area effects (such as fireball or lightning bolt spells) may 
damage items carried by a character as well as injuring  
the character.  For simplicity, assume that items carried  
are unaffected if the character or creature carrying them  
makes their own saving throw.  However, very fragile  
items (paper vs. fire, glass vs. physical impact, etc.) may 
still be considered subject to damage even if the bearer  
makes their save.
In any case where one or more items may be subject to  
damage,  use  the  saving  throw  roll  of  the  bearer  to 
determine if the item is damaged or not.  For example,  
if a character holding an open spellbook is struck by a  
fireball spell, they must save vs. Spells, and then save  
again at the same odds for the spellbook.
The GM should feel free to amend this rule as they  
wish; for instance, a backpack full of fragile items might  
be given a single saving throw rather than laboriously  
rolling for each and every item.

MONSTERS BASIC FANTASY RPG
PART 6:  MONSTERS
Name:  The first thing given for each monster is its  
name  (or its most  common name,  if  the  monster is 
known by more than one).
Armor Class:  This line lists the creature’s Armor Class. 
If the monster customarily wears armor, the first listed  
AC  value  is  with  that  armor,  and  the  second,  in 
parentheses, is unarmored.  Some monsters are only  
able to be hit (damaged) by silver or magical weapons;  
these are indicated with (s); some monsters may only  
be hit with magical weapons, indicated by (m). 
Hit Dice :  This is the creature’s number of hit dice,  
including any bonus hit points.  Monsters always roll  
eight  sided dice  (d8) for hit  points,  unless otherwise  
noted.  So for example, a creature with 3+2 hit dice  
rolls 3d8 and adds 2 points to the total.  A few monsters 
may be marked as having ½ hit dice; this means 1d4  
points, and the creature has "less than one hit die" for  
attack bonus purposes.
One or two asterisks (*) may appear after the hit dice  
figure; where present,  they indicate a Special Ability  
Bonus  to  experience  points  (XP)  awarded  for  the 
monster.   See  Character  Advancement  in  the  
Adventure section for more details.
If  the  monster's  Attack  Bonus is  different  than  its 
number of Hit Dice, for convenience the Attack Bonus  
will be listed in parentheses after the Hit Dice figure.
Movement:  This is the monster's  movement rate , or  
rates for those monsters able to move in more than one  
fashion.  For example, bugbears have a normal walking  
movement of 30 ', and this is all that is listed for them.  
Mermaids can only move about in the water, and so  
their movement is given as Swim 40'.  Pegasi can both  
walk and fly, so their movement is listed as  80' Fly  
160'.
In addition, a distance may appear in parentheses after  
a  movement  figure;  this  is  the  creature's  turning  
distance (as explained in Maneuverability on page 51). 
If a turning distance is not listed, assume 5'.
Attacks:  This is the number (and sometimes type or  
types)  of  attacks  the  monster  can  perform.   For  
example, goblins may attack once with a weapon, so  
they  are  marked  1  weapon.   Ghouls  are  marked  
2 claws, 1 bite as they can attack with both claws and  
also bite in one round.  Some monsters have alternate  
attacks, such as the triceratops with an attack of 1 gore 
or 1 trample  which means that the creature can do a  
gore attack or a trample attack, but not both in the  
same round.
Damage:  The damage figures caused by successful  
attacks by the monster.  Generally this will be defined in 
terms of one or more die rolls.
No. Appearing:  This is given in terms of one or more  
die rolls.  Monsters that only appear underground and  
have no lairs will have a single die roll; those that have  
lairs and/or those that can be found in the wilderness  
will be noted appropriately.  For example, a monster  
noted as "1d6, Wild 2d6, Lair 3d6" is encountered in  
groups of 1d6 individuals in a dungeon setting, 2d6  
individuals in the wilderness, or 3d6 individuals in a lair.
Note  that  number  appearing  applies  to  combatants. 
Non-combatant  monsters  (juveniles,  and  sometimes 
females) do not count in this number.  The text of the  
monster description should explain this in detail where  
it matters, but the GM is always the final arbiter.
Save  As:  This  is  the  character  class  and  level  the 
monster uses for saving throws.  Most monsters save as  
Fighters of a level equal to their hit dice, but this is not  
always the case.
Morale:  The number that must be rolled equal to or  
less than  on  2d6  for the  monster  to  pass  a  Morale 
Check.   Monsters  having  a  Morale  of  12  never  fail 
morale checks, and fight until destroyed (or until they  
have no enemies left).  Morale is explained further on  
page 57.
Treasure  Type:  This  describes  any  valuables  the  
monster is likely to have.  See the Treasure section on 
page  163 for more details about interpreting the letter  
codes which usually appear here.  A monster's treasure  
is normally found in its lair, unless described otherwise;  
sometimes for monsters who live in towns or other large 
groups this line will describe both the lair treasure as  
well as treasure carried by random individuals.
XP:  This is the number of experience points awarded  
for defeating this monster.  In some cases, the figure will 
vary; for instance, Dragons of different age categories  
will have different XP values.  Review the Experience  
Points awards table in the Adventure section on page  
49 to calculate the correct figure in these cases.

For  convenience,  animals  commonly  used  to  carry 
loads and/or characters are listed here together.  Such  
creatures obviously have no treasure.
Camels are large animals found in arid environments  
that bear distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on 
their backs. There are two relevant species of camel  
described  here:  the  far  more  common  one-humped 
dromedary,  and  the  two-humped  Bactrian  camel.  
Statistics presented above are for the dromedary; the  
Bactrian camel is slower and its movement is given in  
brackets.  A light load for a camel is up to 400 pounds;  
a heavy load, up to 800 pounds.
Donkeys are hoofed mammals in the same family as  
the horse.  They are smaller, but are strong and hardy.  
Burros are a similar species, and the statistics herein can 
be used for either; both varieties are capable of being  
taken into dungeons as pack animals.  A light load for a  
donkey is up to 70 pounds; a heavy load, up to 140  
pounds.
Draft  Horses are  large  horses  bred  to  be  working 
animals doing hard tasks such as plowing and other  
farm labor. There are a number of breeds, with varying  
characteristics, but all share common traits of strength,  
patience, and a docile temperament.  A light load for a  
draft horse is up to 350 pounds; a heavy load, up to  
700 pounds.
Riding Horses are smaller horses bred and trained for  
riding.  They cannot effectively fight while the rider is  
mounted.  A light load for a riding horse is up to 250  
pounds; a heavy load, up to 500 pounds.
War Horses are large, powerful horses which are both  
bred  for their  size,  strength,  and  combat  ability  and 
trained to tolerate the sounds and stresses of battle.  
They are able to attack while the rider is mounted due  
to their training.  A light load for a warhorse is up to  
350 pounds; a heavy load, up to 700 pounds.
Mules are a domestic equine hybrid between a donkey  
and a horse.  Mules vary widely in size, and may be of  
any color.  They are more patient, hardier and longer-
lived than horses, and are perceived as less obstinate  
and more intelligent than donkeys.  Like donkeys, they  
are  capable  of  being  taken  into  dungeons  as  pack 
animals.  A light load for a mule is up to 300 pounds; a  
heavy load, up to 600 pounds.
A  Pony is a variety  of  small  horse.  Compared to a  
larger horse, a pony may have a thicker coat, mane and 
tail,  with  proportionally  shorter  legs,  a  wider  barrel, 
heavier bone, a thicker neck and a shorter, broader  
head.  Ponies can be trained for war, and the morale in  
parentheses  above  is for  a  war  pony;  this  does not 
allow them to fight while a rider is mounted, however.  
A light load for a pony is up to 275 pounds; a heavy  
load, up to 550 pounds.

Giant  ants  are  fantastically  enlarged  versions  of  the 
more common variety of ants.  Normal workers are 5 to 
6 feet long; queens are larger, growing up to 9 feet in  
length.  Giant ants may be red or black; there is no  
statistical difference between them.  Though relatively  
shy when first encountered, once combat begins they  
will fight to the death.  They are known to collect shiny  
things, and so will sometimes have a small amount of  
treasure in their lair.
Giant ants may occasionally mine shiny metals such as  
gold or silver; one in three (1-2 on 1d6) giant ant lairs  
will contain 1d100 x 1d100 gp value in relatively pure  
nuggets.
Large and huge ants are similar to giant ants in all ways  
except for size; large ants are 1 to 2 feet long, while  
huge ants are 3 to 4 feet in length.  Though smaller,  
their colonies have more members, and so their lair  
treasures are of similar size to those found in the lairs of  
giant ants.

The statistics above represent the swifter sorts of wild  
herd  animals,  including  deer  (1  hit  die,  usually),  
antelope (2 hit dice), elk (3 hit dice), and moose (4 hit  
dice).  They are skittish and will flee if provoked, but  
males are more aggressive in the presence of females  
(use the parenthesized morale in this case).
Cattle,  aurochs,  and  bison  are  not  included  in  this 
category but rather can be found on page 72.
Generally, 1 hit die herd animals inflict 1d4 points of  
damage on a hit, 2 and 3 hit die animals inflict 1d6, and 
4 hit die animals inflict 1d8.  The GM should feel free to 
vary from these figures as he or she sees fit; there are  
many types of herd animals in the world, and some are  
better armed than others.

Barklings  are  diminutive  furry  humanoids  with  very 
dog-like faces.  They stand between 2½ and 3½ feet tall  
and typically weigh around 45 pounds.  They are pack  
hunters by nature, shy when encountered singly or in  
small  groups  but  bold  when  their  numbers  are  
overwhelming.  Use the higher morale figure when a  
barkling  group  outnumbers  their  enemies  by  3  
combatants to 1 or more.
Barklings can deliver a nasty bite but prefer to fight with  
weapons, favoring small weapons made for their stature 
and relative lack of strength; all such weapons do 1d4  
points of damage on a hit.
Barklings see well in the dark, having Darkvision with a  
range of 30 feet, but their sense of smell is where they  
excel;  a  barkling  can  track  almost  any  living  or  
corporeal undead creature by scent, even if it has been  
as much as a day since it passed.
In  combat  barklings  usually  wear  chainmail  armor 
which they craft themselves (as shown in the Armor  
Class given above).
One out of every ten barklings will be a warrior with 1  
hit die (25 XP).  In barkling encampments, one out of  
every twenty will be a chieftain of 2 hit dice (75 XP)  
having  a +1 bonus  to damage  due  to strength.   In  
villages of 50 or more there will be a barkling lord of 3  
hit  dice  (145  XP)  who  has  +1  bonus  to  damage. 
Barklings gain a +1 bonus to their morale as long as  
they are led by any of their leaders.
In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a 
wizard being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a chieftain is  
present).  A wizard is equivalent to a 1 hit die warrior  
barkling statistically, but has Magic-User abilities at level  
1d4+1.  For XP purposes, treat the wizard barkling as if  
it has a number of hit dice equal to its magic-user level  
-1, and assign one special ability bonus asterisk.
Barklings  are  sometimes  confused  with  kobolds,  for 
whom they have a particular hatred; calling a barkling a  
kobold or suggesting that the two species are related is  
considered a terrible insult.

A basilisk is a giant six-legged lizard-like monster that  
petrifies living creatures with its gaze.  A basilisk has  
dark brown, green, or black skin on its back and a pale  
yellow or white belly.  Adults reach a body length of 5  
to 7  feet  with  a  tail  of  roughly  equal  length,  and a 
weight of 250 to 400 pounds.  There is no particular  
difference in size between males and females.
Any living creature meeting the gaze of a basilisk must  
save  vs.  Petrify  or  be  turned  to  stone  instantly.   In 
general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet  
its gaze.  Those who attempt to fight the monster while

averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2  
to  AC.   It  is  possible  to  use  a  mirror  to  fight  the 
monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack  
and  no  penalty  to  AC.   If  a  basilisk  sees  its  own 
reflection  in  a  mirror  it  must  save  vs.  Petrify  or  be 
turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power to  
petrify.   Basilisks  instinctively  avoid  mirrors  or  other 
reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed,  
but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster  
with a mirror it may see its reflection.
The greater basilisk appears identical to the common  
variety, save that it is larger, having a body length of  
about 8 feet with a 7 to 9 foot long tail and weighing  
between 400 and 750 pounds.  The skin of the greater  
basilisk  is  toxic  to  the  touch,  such  that  any  living 
creature bitten by one or who touches one with bare  
skin must save vs. Poison or die.  This effect persists  
even after the monster is dead, typically for about 2d20  
hours; the only way to tell if the effect has subsided is to 
touch the corpse, an obviously bad idea.

Bats have a natural sonar that allows them to operate in 
total darkness; for game purposes, treat this ability as  
equivalent to Darkvision.
A group of normal-sized bats has no effective attack (at  
least  in terms of  inflicting  damage),  but  can confuse 
those in the area, flying around apparently randomly.  
For every ten bats in the area, one creature can be  
confused; such a creature will suffer a penalty of -2 on  
all attack and saving throw rolls while the bats remain in 
the area.
A giant bat has a wingspan of 15 feet and weighs about  
200 pounds.  They have the same sensory abilities as  
normal-sized bats, but being much larger, they are able  
to attack adventurers; many are carnivorous, making  
such attacks likely.

Giant bombardier beetles have red head and thorax  
sections and black abdomens.  They are 3 to 4 feet  
long.   In  combat,  a  giant  bombardier  beetle  bites 
opponents in front of it, and sprays a cone of very hot  
and noxious gases from a nozzle in the rearmost tip of  
the abdomen.  This toxic blast causes 2d6 points of  
damage to all within a cone 10' long and 10' wide at the 
far  end  (a  save  vs.  Death  Ray  for  half  damage  is 
allowed).  A giant bombardier beetle can use this spray  
attack up to five times per day, but no more than once  
per three rounds.  Faced with enemies attacking from  
one direction, a giant bombardier beetle may choose to  
turn away and use the spray attack rather than biting.
Giant bombardier beetles, like most beetles, have about

In addition to its bite, a giant oil beetle can attack with a  
spray of oil from its abdomen; this can only be applied  
to opponents within 5 feet of the back of the beetle,  
and an attack roll is needed to hit.  Living creatures hit  
by this spray suffer a penalty of -2 on all attack rolls for

Blink dogs, also known as flicker beasts, are strange  
creatures which resemble wolves or hyenas who can  
teleport up to 120 feet at will.  Teleportation is so easy  
for them that they can sometimes teleport away before  
being  attacked.   When  one  knows  of  the  attacker's 
action (i.e. can see or possibly hear the attack about to  
happen) it is allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray, and  
on  a  successful  roll  it  teleports  1d6  x  10  feet  in  a 
random direction (but never into solid matter, nor into  
any dangerous area the creature knows about).
These  creatures  are  pack  hunters,  using  their  
teleportation to confuse their prey until they are able to  
surround it.  In this way, some members of the pack will

be able to attack from behind, a trick they are so good  
at that they receive the same benefits as a thief: +4 to  
hit and double damage if the hit is successful.
Blink dogs are large canines, typically light brown in  
color with short bristly hair; some varieties are striped or 
spotted.  They communicate using a language of barks,  
growls,  and yips which  is somewhat limited but  can  
convey  useful  tactical  information.   They  are  shy,  
generally  avoiding  a  fight  if  possible,  but  they  hate 
deceivers and will generally attack them on sight.

Blood roses appear to be normal rose bushes, but are  
actually  animated  plants,  dimly  aware  of  their  
surroundings.   These  plants  are  always  in  bloom,  
bearing  beautiful flowers that  are normally white (or  
rarely, yellow) in color.
The fragrance of the flowers is detectable up to 30' from 
the plant in ideal conditions.  Blood roses can move  
about  slowly, and will  try  to find locations  sheltered  
from  the  wind  in  order  to  achieve  those  ideal  
conditions.  Living creatures who smell the fragrance  
must  save  vs.  Poison  or  become  befuddled;  such  a 
victim will drop anything carried and try to approach  
the plant.  Each round an unaffected living creature can  
smell the fragrance it must make this save.  Befuddled  
creatures will not resist the attacks of the blood rose; if  
affected creatures are removed from the area, the effect  
of the fragrance will expire 2d4 rounds later.  Undead  
monsters, constructs, etc. are not affected.
Each blood rose plant will have 1, 2 or 3 whiplike canes 
studded with thorns with which it can attack.  When a  
cane hits, it wraps around the victim and begins to drain 
blood, doing 1d6 points of damage per round.  A blood 
rose which has recently (within one day) "eaten" in this  
way will have flowers ranging from pink to deep wine  
red in color, which will fade slowly back to white or

Bugbears look like huge, hairy goblins, standing about  
6 feet tall.  Their eyes are usually a darkish brown color  
and they move very quietly.  They are wild and cruel,  
and bully smaller humanoids whenever possible.
Bugbear attacks are coordinated, and their tactics are  
sound if not brilliant.  They are able to move in nearly  
complete silence, surprising opponents on 1-3 on 1d6.  
In order to remain silent, they must wear only leather or 
hide  armor,  as  indicated  in  the  Armor  Class  scores 
above.  Bugbears receive a +1 bonus on damage due  
to  their  great  Strength.   As  with  most  goblinoid  
monsters, they have Darkvision with a 30' range.
One out of every eight bugbears will be a hardened  
warrior of 4+4 Hit Dice (240 XP), with a +2 bonus to  
damage.  In lairs of 16 or more bugbears, there will be  
a chieftain of 6+6 Hit Dice (500 XP), with a +3 bonus  
to damage.  Bugbears gain a +1 bonus to their morale  
if they are led by a hardened warrior or chieftain.  In  
the lair, bugbears never fail a morale check as long as  
the chieftain is alive.  In addition, there is a 2 in 6

Caecilia  are  carnivorous,  legless  amphibians;  they

skeletons  and  sharp  teeth.   Caecilia  live  entirely  
underground.  The giant variety can grow up to 30'  
long and frequently are found in caverns or dungeons.  
They are nearly blind, but caecilia are very sensitive to  
sound and vibrations, and are able to find their prey  
regardless of light or the absence thereof.
A giant caecilia can swallow a single small humanoid  
(such as a goblin or halfling) whole.  On a natural attack 
roll  of 19 or 20,  such a victim  has been swallowed  
(assuming  that  roll  does  actually  hit  the  victim).   A 
swallowed victim suffers 1d8 damage per round, and  
may only attack from the inside with a small cutting or  
stabbing weapon such as a dagger.  While the inside of  
the caecilia is easier for the victim to hit, fighting while  
swallowed is more difficult, so no modifiers to the attack 
roll are applied.
Once  a  caecilia  has  swallowed  an  opponent,  it  will 
generally attempt to disengage from combat, going to  
its lair to rest and digest its meal.

Cattle  are  large  mammals  with  cloven  hooves  and 
horned heads.  Cattle are raised mostly for their meat  
(beef), leather, and milk.  Cattle eat grass and are fairly  
gentle unless spooked, in which case they will stampede 
(run in a group). Anyone  caught in the path of the  
stampede will suffer at least one trampling attack, as  
determined by the GM.  Male cattle are called bulls,  
females  are  cows,  and  young  are  calves  (calf  is  
singular).  If attacked, cattle will charge, generally using  
their horns to attack.  Bulls are larger (+1 hit die), less  
easily frightened (use the second listed morale figure),  
and are quite aggressive in defense of the herd.  A bull  
will  likely  attack  if  he  sees  quick  movements  from 
creatures  he  might  be  able  to  reach  with  a  charge. 
Meanwhile, if unable to flee cows will usually assume a  
roughly  circular  formation  with  their  heads  outward, 
while calves will be kept in the center, though if the  
opponents are small enough they may instead charge  
en masse, trampling all creatures in their path.
A typical small farm with cattle will have a bull, 5d4  
cows, and 2d10 calves (but not more than the number  
of cows).
Aurochs are wild cattle; they are shaggy and rough-
looking.  Bison are the largest species of wild bovines.  
All types of bovines tend to behave in the same general  
way, as described above.
An ox is typically a castrated bull used as a draft animal; 
females may be used, rarely, but males are preferred  
due to their greater size and strength.  Oxen are usually 
paired as a team to pull a fully-loaded wagon (or the  
equivalent of 3,000 lb).  Oxen require less food and  
water, being able to eat rough grass better than draft  
horses, which makes them valuable to merchants with  
large caravans going over semi-arid prairie.

Giant cave locusts are pale, cricket-like creatures that  
live underground.  An average giant cave locust is 2 to  
4  feet  long.   They  are  eyeless,  depending  on  their 
sound-sensitive antennae, vibration-sensitive feet and a  
variety of touch-sensitive "hairs" on their legs to sense  
the environment around them.
These  creatures  eat  subterranean  fungus  (including 
shriekers) as well as carrion; they are not predators, but  
if  disturbed  they  will  attack,  shrieking  loudly,  biting, 
jumping wildly around, or spitting nasty goo.
All  giant  cave  locusts  in  a  group  will  shriek  when 
disturbed,  attracting  wandering  monsters.   The  GM 
should roll a wandering monster check each round that  
one or more cave locusts are attacking; if wandering  
monsters are indicated, they will arrive in 1d4 rounds.
Any giant cave locust that is engaged (adjacent to an  
opponent) will attempt to bite, doing 1d2 damage on a  
successful hit.  This does not interrupt the monster's  
shrieking.
A giant cave locust can leap up to 60' horizontally, or  
up to 30' up.  If one of these creatures is not engaged at 
the beginning of the round, it will leap toward one of  
the opponent creatures; roll a normal attack roll, and if  
the attack hits, the target creature takes 1d4 points of  
non-lethal damage from the impact.
Finally, a giant cave locust can spray a greenish-brown  
goo (its digestive juices) up to 10' away.  Each giant  
cave  locust  can  perform  this  attack  just  once  per 
encounter.  This spit attack will usually be reserved until  
they fail a morale check, in which case all remaining  
giant cave locusts will spit at their nearest opponent,  
and then all will attempt to flee in the next round.  To  
spit  on  an  opponent,  the  giant  cave  locust  rolls  an 
attack  against  Armor  Class  11  (plus  Dexterity  and 
magical bonuses, but no normal armor value applies).  
If the attack hits, the target must save vs. Poison or be  
unable  to  do  anything  for  3d6  rounds  due  to  the 
horrible smell.

Centaurs appear to be half man, half horse, having the  
torso, arms and head of a man in the position a horse's  
head would otherwise occupy.  The horse part of a  
centaur is as large and powerful as a warhorse; males  
average 7 feet in height and weigh about a ton (2,000  
pounds), while females are just a bit shorter and very  
close to the same weight.  Centaurs may charge with a  
spear or lance just as a man on horseback, with the  
same bonuses.  They typically wear leather armor when 
prepared for combat.
Centaurs  are  generally  haughty  and  aloof,  but  very

Giant centipedes are larger versions of the normal sort,  
being 2 to 3 feet long.  Centipedes are fast-moving,  
predatory,  venomous  arthropods,  having  long  
segmented bodies with exoskeletons.  They prefer to  
live in underground areas, shadowy forested areas, and  
other places out of direct sunlight; however, there are  
desert-dwelling  varieties  that  hide  under  the  sand  
waiting for prey to wander by.
These  creatures  are  aggressive  and  always  hungry, 
attacking any living creature and only checking morale  
if injured.  Giant centipedes attack with a poisonous  
bite,  and  those  bitten  must  save  vs.  Poison  or  die; 
however, the poison is somewhat weak and thus grants  
a bonus of +2 on the saving throw.

Chimeras are  strange  creatures having  a  lion's  body

wings of a dragon.  The dragon head of a chimera  
could be any common dragon except cloud (i.e. desert,  
forest, ice, mountain, plains, or sea), and has the same  
type  of  breath  weapon  as  that  sort  of  dragon.  
Regardless of type, the dragon's head breathes a 50'

cockatrice has wattles and a full comb, while the much  
rarer females have neither.  An individual cockatrice  
weighs  more  than  a  chicken,  averaging  about  20

Giant crabs naturally resemble the ordinary variety, but  
are much larger, averaging 5' in diameter (not counting

Deceivers are greenish-black catlike monsters with thick  
serpents extending from their shoulders.  All three of  
the  monster's  mouths  can  bite,  though  the  smaller 
serpent heads do not do as much damage.
The real power and danger of the deceiver is its power  
of  deception,  a  mental  ability  which  causes  those 
attacking the monster to believe the creature is about 3  
feet  from  its true location.   Any  character fighting  a 
deceiver  for  the  first  time  will  miss  their  first  strike 
regardless of the die roll.  Thereafter, all attacks against  
deceivers will be at a penalty of -2 to the attack roll.  
This  is  not  cumulative  with  the  penalty  for  fighting 
blind.  As a mental power, this ability does not affect  
mindless creatures, constructs such as golems or living  
statues, or any sort of undead.  Living creatures which  
are not mindless will be affected even if they do not use  
sight to target the deceiver.
Greater  Deceivers are  larger  and  more  fierce  than 
common Deceivers, and on top of that, their serpent  
heads have a deadly venomous bite; victims must save  
vs. Poison or die.

A triceratops is a three-horned herbivorous dinosaur.  
They  are  aggressive  toward  interlopers,  attacking  
anyone who might appear to be a threat.  Individuals  
are quite large, weighing 11,000 to 20,000 pounds and  
ranging from 26 to 30 feet in length.
When facing opponents of smaller size, a triceratops will 
usually  attempt  to  trample  them,  reserving  the  gore 
attack for larger opponents.  Up to two adjacent man-
sized or up to four smaller opponents may be trampled  
simultaneously; the triceratops rolls a single attack roll  
which is compared to the Armor Class of each of the  
potential victims, and then rolls a separate damage roll  
for each one successfully hit.  The gore attack may only  
be used against a single man-sized or larger creature,  
but may be used in the same round as the trample if  
the creature being gored is larger than man sized.  Also  
note that a charging bonus may be applied to the gore

The  tyrannosaurus  rex  is  a  bipedal  carnivorous  
dinosaur with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy 
tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, its  
forelimbs are short but unusually powerful for their size,  
with two clawed digits.  Despite this, they are not used  
to  attack,  as  the  tyrannosaur's  powerful  bite  is  its 
preferred weapon.
Individuals can grow to lengths of over 40 feet and can  
weigh  up  to 20,000  pounds,  though  most  are  a  bit 
smaller than this, averaging around 35 feet in length  
and 17,000 pounds in weight.

Djinn (singular djinni) are a race of manlike creatures  
believed to be from the Elemental Plane of Air.  They  
are large beings, 10 to 11 feet in height and weighing  
around 1,000 pounds, though their weight is generally  
immaterial due to their ability to fly by magical means.
The djinni's morale  
score of 12 reflects  
its absolute  control 
over  its  own  fear, 
but  does  not  
indicate  that  the  
creature  will  throw 
its life away easily.  
Use  the  "8"  figure 
to  determine  
whether  an  
outmatched  djinni  
decides  to  leave  a 
combat.
Djinn  have  a  
number of  magical 
powers,  which  can 
be used at will (that  
is, without needing  
magic  words  or  
gestures):  create food and drink , creating  tasty  and 
nourishing  food  for  up  to  2d6  humans  or  similar 
creatures,  once  per  day;  become  invisible,  with 
unlimited uses per day; create normal items , creating 
up to 1,000 pounds of soft goods or wooden items of  
permanent nature or metal goods lasting at most a day,  
once per day; assume gaseous form, as the potion, up  
to one hour per day; and create illusions, as the spell  
phantasmal force but including sound as well as visual  
elements, three times per day.
Djinn may assume the form of a whirlwind at will, with  
no limit as to the number of times per day this power  
may be used; a djinni in whirlwind form fights as if it  
were an air elemental.
Due  to their highly  magical  nature,  djinn  cannot  be 
harmed by non-magical weapons.  They are immune to 
normal cold, and suffer only half damage from magical  
attacks based on either cold or wind.

Dopplegangers are weird humanoid creatures who are  
able to take on the appearance of nearly any other  
humanoid ranging from 3 feet up to 7 feet in height.  
They can also read minds (as the spell, mind reading, 
but with unlimited duration), an ability that can even be  
used  to  speak  any  language  known  to  the  creature 
whose mind is being read.  In their natural form (which  
few creatures ever see) they are pale and pasty looking,  
slim,  around  5½  feet  tall  and  weighing  about  150 
pounds.  Their features look unformed and incomplete.
Dopplegangers wish to live a life of ease, and in pursuit  
of that  goal  they will  seek to take  the  place of any  
character they meet who they believe can help them get 
that  kind of life.   This usually means separating the  
victim from any allies and quietly killing them.  While a  
doppleganger  can  duplicate  the  appearance  of  the 
clothing and equipment worn by a creature, such items  
are part of the creature and cannot, for example, be  
laid down or handed to someone.  Taking the clothing  
and equipment of a victim is thus the preferred tactic.
A doppleganger can mimic the sound of the voice of  
any living creature as well as the appearance of any  
humanoid.  Their mind reading ability will be used to  
help them behave like the person they have replaced.
Dragon
Dragons  are  large  (sometimes  very  large)  winged  
reptilian monsters.  Unlike wyverns, dragons have four  
legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish  
"true" dragons from other large reptilian monsters.  All  
dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long 
as they live.  For this reason, they are described as  
having seven "age categories," ranging from 3 less to 3  
more hit dice than the average.  For convenience, a  
table  is  provided  following  the  description  of  each 
dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice,  
damage from their various attacks, and other features  
peculiar to dragons.
If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a  
male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3);  
two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice  
(1d4-2).  If three or four are encountered, they consist  
of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in  
size.  If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of  
12 in combat since they are protecting their young.
In combat dragons use a powerful bite, slashing claws,  
a long, whiplike tail, and most famously some form of  
breath weapon.  Tactically, dragons prefer to fight while

flying,  making  passes over  ground-based enemies to  
strike or breathe on them.  Smarter and older dragons  
will  look  for the  toughest  or  most  dangerous foe  to 
strike  down  first,  particularly  preferring  to  eliminate 
magic-users as early in a fight as possible.
Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times  
per day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the  
lowest age category do not yet have a breath weapon.  
The breath may be used no more often than every  
other round, and the dragon may use its claws and tail  
in the same round.  The tail swipe attack may only be  
used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while  
the claws may be used only on those opponents in  
front of the creature.  Due to their serpentine necks,  
dragons may bite in any direction, even behind them.
The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of  
damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8  
points of damage with its breath).  Victims may make a  
save vs. Dragon Breath for half damage.  The breath  
weapon may be projected in any direction around the  
dragon,  even  behind,  for  the  same  reason  that  the 
dragon can bite those behind it.
There  are  three  shapes  (or  areas of  effect)  which  a 
dragon's breath weapon can cover.  Each variety has a  
"normal" shape, which that type of dragon can use from 
the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward.  Upon  
reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon  
learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other  
shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3  
hit dice), the dragon can produce all three shapes.
The shapes are:
Cone  Shaped:  The  breath  weapon  begins  at  the  
dragon's mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it  
extends  up  to  the  maximum  length  (based  on  the 
dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that  
point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age).
Line  Shaped:   The  breath  weapon  is  5'  wide  
(regardless of the given width figure) and extends the  
given length in a straight line.
Cloud Shaped:  The breath weapon covers an area up  
to the maximum given width (based on the dragon type 
and age) in both length and width (that is, any length  
figure given for the dragon type and age is ignored).  A  
cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or  
high.
All dragons save for those of the lowest age category  
are  able  to  speak  Dragon.   Each  type  has  a  given 
chance of "talking;" this is the chance that the dragon  
will know Common or some other humanoid language.  
Many who talk choose to learn Elvish.  If the first roll for 
"talking" is successful, the GM may roll again, with each  
additional  roll  adding  another  language  which  the 
dragon may speak.
Some  dragons  learn  to  cast  spells;  the  odds  that  a 
dragon can cast spells are the same as the odds that a  
dragon will learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each  
is rolled for separately.
All  dragons  crave  wealth,  hoarding  as  many  coins, 
gems, items of jewelry, and best of all magic items in  
their lair as possible.  The greater a dragon's hoard, the  
less it will seek to leave its lair, though of course it must  
hunt for food from time to time.  Dragons rarely trust  
any other creature to defend their hoard, though some  
will entice aggressive but unintelligent creatures to live  
nearby  in  the  hopes  that  they  will  kill  and  eat  any 
thieves who might come nosing around.
Unlike other monsters, multiple dragons encountered in 
a lair together do not share treasure; generate a full  
treasure  for  each  dragon  individually.   Treasure  for 
dragons is special, as noted on the table on page 164. 
The  odds  of  monetary  treasure  increase  with  the 
monster's  age  category,  while  the  chances  of  gems, 
jewelry, and magic items are based upon its hit dice.
Young dragons typically have brightly colored, glossy  
skin; as a dragon ages, both the color and the sheen

Cloud dragons have the most varied appearance of all  
the true dragons.  In an indoor environment or when  
underground  a cloud dragon appears to be a bright  
metallic color, while outdoors their coloration is brighter  
and less metallic, and may take on a reddish or bluish  
cast reminiscent of a sunrise or sunset.  Hatchlings have  
a coppery skin tone, brightening to silver at the second  
age category, then to gold at the fourth before fading to  
a platinum tone by age category 6.  While most true  
dragons become duller in color and sheen as they age,  
cloud dragons do not.
Cloud dragons are not cruel and do not seek to kill for  
pleasure.  Many tales are told of cloud dragons offering  
assistance to adventurers, though they are every bit as  
avaricious as any dragon; adventurers in need of gold  
need not bother asking for a loan.
Another way in which cloud dragons differ from other  
types is that they do not have fixed breath weapons.  
Upon  reaching  the  second  age  category,  a  cloud 
dragon  acquires  the  breath  weapon  of  a  randomly-
chosen (or GM assigned) dragon type; upon reaching  
the fourth age category, they acquire a second breath  
weapon  type.   Cloud  dragons  possess  the  same  
immunities as the dragons whose breath weapons they  
reproduce.
All cloud dragons have the power to assume the form  
of  any  type  of  humanoid  (as  described  in  the  spell 
charm person) at will in a manner otherwise equivalent 
to the spell polymorph self.

Desert dragons have rough, gritty-feeling hide which is  
a dark steel blue color with a smoother, streaky brown  
underbelly.  Their bodies are wiry and serpentine.
They hunt by day in the heat of the sun, sometimes  
flying  high  overhead  looking  for  prey,  or  sometimes 
choosing to bury themselves in the sand and lie in wait  
with only eyes and nostrils exposed.  One will wait in  
this fashion  until victims come within 100  feet,  then  
spring out and attack (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6  
in this case).
A  desert  dragon  will  usually  choose  to  lair  in  an 
underground cavern, or perhaps in a ruined castle or  
desert outpost.  They are evil monsters, though not so  
fierce as mountain dragons.  They particularly enjoy  
tricking  intelligent  prey  into  entering  their  lairs  or  
passing  by  their  hiding  places  to  be  ambushed  and 
killed; usually one member of a party attacked by a  
desert  dragon will  be  left  alive  for a  while,  and  the 
dragon will play with that person as a cat plays with a  
mouse.
Desert dragons are immune to normal lightning, and  
suffer only half damage from magical lightning.

Forest dragons are bright leaf green in color, with a tan  
underbelly.  They have long sinuous bodies and move  
with catlike grace.  They are cruel monsters, but they  
are renowned for their curiosity.  They especially like to  
question adventurers to learn more about their society  
and abilities, what is going on in the countryside, and if  
there is treasure nearby.  Adventurers may be allowed  
to live so long as they remain interesting… but woe to  
them when the dragon becomes bored.
Forest dragons are immune to all poisons.  Note that,  
despite their breath weapon being described as "poison  
gas," damage done by it is exactly the same as with  
other dragons.  More specifically, those in the area of  
effect do not have to "save or die" as with ordinary  
poison,  but  rather  save  vs.  Dragon  Breath  for  half 
damage.

Ice dragons have pale blue-white skin, ranging from sky  
blue for a hatchling to the stark pure white of an ancient 
individual.  They are the same color all over, having no  
contrasting underbelly color.
They  prefer  to  live  in  cold  regions,  whether  in  the 
highest mountains or in the cold northern lands.  They  
are the least intelligent of dragons, though this does not  
mean  that  they  are  stupid  by  any  stretch  of  the 
imagination.  They are motivated completely by a drive  
to live, to reproduce,  and (of course) to accumulate  
treasure; they kill to live, not for pleasure.
In a fashion similar to swamp and desert dragons, an  
ice dragon will sometimes choose to bury itself in snow  
and wait, with only its eyes and nostrils exposed, in a  
place where prey is likely to pass by.  The ice dragon  
will then burst out when likely prey approaches within  
100', surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6.
Ice dragons are immune to normal cold, and take only  
half damage from magical cold or ice.

Mountain dragons are red in color, ranging from the  
brilliant blood red of a hatchling to the dull terracotta  
color  of  an  ancient  individual.   These  dragons  are 
powerfully  built,  with  heavy-jawed  heads  and  thick 
muscular bodies, yet their necks are still long enough to  
give them the legendary flexibility of a true dragon.
They  are  cruel  monsters,  actively  seeking  to  hunt, 
torment, kill and consume intelligent creatures.  They  
are often said to prefer women and elves, but in truth a  
mountain dragon will attack almost any creature less  
powerful than itself.
They are intelligent and self-assured, but also impatient  
and overconfident.  One will often plan strategies in  
advance and then choose one at random when facing  
unknown opponents, without regard to whether or not  
the strategy is likely to work.  The sheer power of a  
mountain dragon is often the only reason one is still  
alive.
Mountain  dragons  are  immune  to  normal  fire,  and 
suffer only half damage from magical fire.

Plains dragons are  the  smallest  of  the  true  dragons. 
They have yellow skin dappled with light green patches, 
spots, or sometimes thin stripes.  The color dulls and  
darkens with age until it reaches an almost uniform tan  
color  at  the  oldest  age  category.   They  have  long 
sinuous bodies and unusually long legs, giving them the  
fastest land movement rate of any dragon, but they are  
also accomplished fliers, as fast and maneuverable as  
any dragon.
Plains  dragons  may  hunt  on  the  wing,  attacking  
suddenly from above and surprising on 1-3 on 1d6; or,  
they may lie in wait in tall grass or a copse of trees,  
using their coloration as camouflage.  As one ages and  
its colors dull, this ability improves; when lying in wait,  
they gain surprise on 1-3 on 1d6 at age categories 2  
and 3, on 1-4 in age categories 4 through 6, and on 1-5 
at age category 7.
The breath weapon of the plains dragon is a scorching,  
shimmering cone of heat, barely visible to the naked  
eye; at night, however, a glow like steel being forged  
can be seen streaming from the dragon's open mouth.

Young sea dragons are light bluish-gray in color (similar  
to dolphins), darkening to a deep slate color in older  
individuals.  Their skin is smooth and sleek, and their  
bodies are more compact than most dragons, though  
their long neck gives them the same flexibility.
Though  they  live  in  the  water  and  are  somewhat 
adapted to it, sea dragons still must breathe air, similar  
to  dolphins  or  whales.   A  sea  dragon  may  hold  its 
breath up to three turns while swimming or performing  
other moderate activity.
These dragons have much the same physical structure  
as other dragons, but their feet are webbed and their  
tails are short, flat and broad; these adaptations help  
the sea dragon swim efficiently, but severely limit their  
ability to walk on dry land.  Unlike other dragons, sea  
dragons do not have a tail attack.  The breath weapon  
of a sea dragon is a cloud of steam; they are immune to 
damage from non-magical steam (including the breath  
weapon of another sea dragon), and suffer only half  
damage from magical steam attacks.
Sea dragons are neutral in outlook, in much the same  
way as ice dragons.  They often maintain lairs in air-
filled undersea caverns.

Swamp dragons have green skin so dark as to appear  
to be black, especially in uncertain light or while wet.  
They  often choose  to hide  underwater,  leaving  only 
part  of  the  head  above  the  waterline,  and  leap  up 
suddenly when prey comes within 100' (surprising on a  
roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).
Though  swamp  dragons  are  more  cruel  than  ice  
dragons, they are still motivated mostly by the urge to  
live, breed and collect valuable items.
Swamp dragons are immune to all forms of acid.  A  
swamp dragon may hold its breath up to three turns  
while lying in wait underwater.

Dryads  are  female  nature  spirits;  each  is  mystically 
bound to a single, enormous oak tree and must never  
stray  more  than  300  yards  from  it.   Any  who  do 
become ill and die within 4d6 hours.  A dryad’s oak  
does not radiate magic.  A dryad lives as long as her  
tree, and dies when the tree dies; likewise, if the dryad  
is killed, her tree dies also.
A dryad resembles an elf woman, with skin like fine  
polished wood or smooth bark and hair like leaves; the  
hair color of a dryad usually changes with the seasons,  
being brown in the winter, pale green in the spring,  
darker green in the summer, and yellow, orange, or red  
in the fall.  
Though they are usually content to live alone, dryads  
are often friends with creatures such as treant or other  
nature spirits who might live nearby.  Once per day a  
dryad  can  cast  a  charm  similar  to  the  spell  charm 
person,  and  one  may  choose  to  use  this  ability  to 
compel an interesting human or elf to remain with her  
as a companion for a period of up to a year.  The  
companion can be taken into and brought out of the  
dryad's tree so long as the charm is still in effect.

carry prey up to 15 lbs.  An eagle will also kill and start  
to eat animals that are 5 times the eagle's size, up to 80  
lbs.  Fish-eating eagles are usually the largest varieties,  
while other types hunt small animals such as rodents or  
snakes.  Coloring is dependent on the species of eagle,  
and should be chosen by the GM; various brown, gray,  
black,  or white  markings are  most  common,  though 
solid darker colors are sometimes seen.  The beaks may 
range from bright yellowish orange to black.  Eagles will  
dive at a prey and attack with both sets of talons, then  
attack with the beak.

An average giant eagle has a wingspan of 15 to 20 feet

language common in their home territory.
Individual giant eagles are rarely encountered alone, as  
they  prefer to live in loose communities.  However,  
when they hunt they do so in a solitary fashion, with  
each eagle choosing a single creature as prey.  As they  
can communicate with each other, it is extremely rare  
for two of them to make the mistake of attacking the  
same prey; in fact, it is not uncommon for one to attack  
alone to scatter a group of prey so they can each more  
easily choose a victim.
Giant  eagles  mate  for  life.   If  a  nest  with  eggs  or 
hatchlings is threatened, both parents will fight without  
checking  morale,  and  other  giant  eagles  in  their  
community may come to their defense but will still seek  
to scatter any opponents so as to attack them one on  
one.

Efreet (singular efreeti) are a race of manlike creatures  
believed to be from the Elemental Plane of Fire.  They  
are large beings, 11 to 12 feet in height and weighing  
around 2,000 pounds, though their weight is generally  
immaterial due to their ability to fly by magical means.
Note that the 12 morale reflects an efreeti's absolute  
control over its own fear, but does not indicate that the  
creature  will  throw its life away  easily.  Use  the "9"  
figure  to  determine  whether  an  outmatched  efreeti 
decides to leave a combat.
Efreet have a number of magical powers, which can be

gestures):  become  invisible,  with  unlimited  uses  per 
day;  assume  gaseous form , as the potion, up to one  
hour per day; create illusions, as the spell phantasmal 
force but including sound as well as visual elements,  
three times per day; create flame, with unlimited uses;  
and create a  wall of fire  (as the spell), once per day.  
Create  flame  allows  the  efreet  to  cause  a  flame  to 
appear in its hand or otherwise on its person at will; it  
behaves as desired by the efreet, becoming as large as  
a  torch  flame  or  as  small  as  a  candle,  and  ignites 
flammable  material  just  as  any  ordinary  flame  does. 
The flame can be thrown as a weapon with a range of  
up to 60', causing 1d8 points of damage on a successful 
hit.  The efreet can create another flame, and throw it  
as well if desired, once per round.
Efreet may assume the form of a column of fire at will,  
with no limit as to the number of times per day this  
power may be used; an efreeti in flame-form fights as if  
it were a fire elemental.
Due to their highly magical nature, efreet cannot  be  
harmed by non-magical weapons.  They are immune to 
normal fire, and suffer only half damage from magical  
fire attacks.
Elemental
An  elemental  is  a  being  formed  from  one  of  the 
foundational elements of reality.  In Western traditions,  
the  classical  elements are  air,  earth,  fire,  and water; 
Asian traditions  include a different group:  fire, earth,  
metal, water, and wood.  This book presents the full  
range needed for either tradition, and to those types are 
added cold and lightning elementals for those who wish  
to be  less traditional.   As always,  the  Game  Master  
decides what sort of monsters appear in their world,  
and  so  not  all  of  the  following  creatures  may  be 
encountered.
Each  type  of  elemental  may  be  summoned  to  the 
material  plane  by  means  of  one  of  three  different 
methods:
Conjured by  the  5th level  Magic-User  spell  conjure 
elemental; or,
Summoned by means of a magical staff; or,
Summoned by a device, as given in the Miscellaneous 
Magic subsection of the Treasure section of this book.
These three types of elementals are quite reasonably  
called staff, device, and conjured elementals.  The hit  
dice of an elemental depends on the type, as follows:
Type Hit Dice
Staff 8
Device 12
Conjured 16
The summoner of an elemental must concentrate on it  
to control it, and may take no other action, including  
attacking, being attacked, or moving, or control will be  
lost.  Once control is lost it cannot be regained, and the  
uncontrolled elemental will  move  directly toward the  
summoner and attack.
Elementals must be summoned from a large quantity of  
the  appropriate  natural  material.   For  example,  air 
elementals  require  a  large  quantity  of  air  (so  small 
underground spaces will not support the summoning of  
one); earth elementals require access to natural earth or  
stone (and worked stone such as the stone walls of a  
castle will not work); fire elementals require a large fire  
such as a bonfire; and water elementals require access  
to a substantial body of water, at the very least a river  
or lake (small streams and artificial pools will not work).  
Finally,  when  an  elemental  is  summoned,  no  other 
elemental of the same type may be summoned in the  
same day within a radius of 100 miles of the location.

Non-magical  weapons  cannot  harm  an  elemental.  
Attacks made by an elemental should be considered  
magical for purposes of determining how much damage 
creatures resistant to the elemental's attack form should  
suffer.
Generally, elementals are immune to both normal and  
magical forms of their own attack form.  Most are more  
susceptible to attacks from one or two specific other  
types of elemental; this is noted in the text for each  
type.

Air  elementals  resemble  "dust  devils",  that  is,  small 
whirlwinds,  but  they  are  much  more  powerful.   Air 
elementals  take  double  damage  when  attacked  by 
earth-based attacks (including by earth elementals).  An  
air  elemental  may  choose  either  to  attack  a  single 
opponent, thus receiving one attack per round at the  
listed damage, or may choose to knock all opponents in 
a 5' radius to the ground; if the latter attack is used, all  
creatures of 2 hit dice or less must save vs. Death Ray  
or fall prone.  Creatures of 3 or more levels or hit dice

of liquids or jelly.  A cold elemental's body is so bitterly  
cold  that  creatures within  5  feet  take  1d6  points  of 
damage automatically, unless they are immune to the  
effects of cold.  Any liquids the cold elemental touches  
immediately freeze solid.  A cold elemental cannot enter 
places  where  the  temperature  is  above  50  degrees

Fire elementals are simply flames, which may appear  
generally  humanoid  for  brief  moments  when  they 
attack.   Fire  elementals  take  double  damage  when 
attacked by water (including water elementals).    They  
cannot  cross a  body  of  water  wider than their own  
diameter.  They do an additional 1d8 points of damage  
against creatures which are cold or icy in nature.
Remember that a fire elemental is constantly burning;  
such a creature may easily start fires if it moves into an  
area containing items which burn easily, such as dry  
wood, paper, or oil.  No specific rules are given for such 
fires, but the GM is directed to the rules for burning oil  
for an example of fire damage.

A lightning  elemental  resembles dark  clouds lit  from 
within by flashes of lightning.  One can magnetically  
draw metal items towards itself as if using  telekinesis. 
It deals 1d8 extra points of damage to creatures that are 
in contact with water or metal but not touching solid  
ground.  A lightning elemental takes double damage  
when  attacked  by  air  or  wind  attacks  (including  air 
elementals), and from the attacks of wood elementals  
as well.  A lightning elemental  can choose either to  
strike a single creature or create a mighty thunderclap.

Metal  elementals  appear  to  be  somewhat  abstract 
humanoid figures formed from metal.  They are able to  
move as if liquid, though they are cool and hard to the  
touch.  Their semi-liquid form permits them to form  
their extremities into wickedly sharp blades, which is  
their preferred means of attack.  Those wearing metal  
armor receive no protection against a metal elemental  
(except  for  magical  bonuses,  if  any);  indeed,  on  a 
successful  hit  one  deals an  additional  1d8  points  of 
damage  to  creatures,  vehicles,  or  structures  that  are 
made of or in direct contact with some form of metal.  
Lightning  attacks  deal  double  damage  to  a  metal 
elemental.  Like an earth elemental, a metal elemental  
cannot  cross  a  body  of  water  greater  than  its  own 
height.

feet), a single elephant can apply no more than two of  
these  attacks  to  any  single  opponent  of  small  or

Falcons are birds with wingspans of 16 to 20 inches;  
they stand about 1.5 to 2 feet tall and weigh about 3  
pounds.  These are the most popular of the hunting  
birds used by royalty.  Falcons can only carry prey up  
to 1 pound.  They will hunt snakes, small rodents, and  
even other birds such as wild ducks.  Falcons appear in  
a variety of colors, typically ranging from dark gray on  
top to white with dark stripes on the bottom; kestrels, a  
variety of falcon, have reddish brown to dark brown  
feathers with dark stripes.  A falcon typically  attacks  
prey  by  diving,  striking  first  with  the  talons  before 
making the kill with its sharp beak.

Barracuda are predatory fish found in salt water.  Huge  
barracudas are about 12' long, while giant specimens  
can exceed 20'.  They have elongated bodies,  pointed  
heads and prominent jaws.  Their bodies are covered  
with  smooth  scales,  typically  blue,  gray  or  silver  in 
color.   They  have  extremely  keen  eyesight  and  are 
surprised only on a 1 on 1d6.  Due to the quickness of  
their attack, barracuda are capable of surprising on 1-3  
on 1d6 and gain a +2 bonus to Initiative.
Giant  barracuda  always  appear  singly  and  are  50%

Giant  bass  are  generally  between  10'  and  25'  long. 
Most are greenish-grey marked with dark lateral stripes,  
though some are almost completely black.  They are  
generally  found  in  lakes  or  rivers,  as  they  are  not 
adapted for salt water.
Giant bass are predatory, and on a natural attack roll of  
20 a  giant  bass will  swallow whole  a dwarf-sized or  
smaller  creature,  which  then  takes  2d4  damage  per 
round until it is dead.  Swallowed characters can attack  
only with daggers or similar short weapons.  Note that  
each giant bass can swallow at most one character, and  
a  giant  bass  which  has  swallowed  a  character  will

Giant catfish fins are edged with a natural poison that  
causes a painful burning sensation for 3d10 rounds if a  
save vs. Poison is failed.  The pain causes the affected  
character or creature to suffer a -1 penalty on all attack  
rolls and saving throws; further poisonings will increase  
this penalty by -1 each, down to a maximum penalty of  
-5 as well as adding 6 rounds to the duration of the  
poison effect.
Because of its large size (15 to 20 feet long) and body  
design, a giant catfish cannot target more than one of its 
attacks on any single creature; that is, it cannot bite and  
fin the same opponent, nor use both fins on one victim.

Giant frogs are enlarged versions of the common frog;  
most resemble bullfrogs in appearance, but an adult  
giant  frog is 3' long and weighs about  250  pounds.  
They  are  predators,  but  will  normally  only  attack 
creatures  smaller  than  themselves.   Giant  toads  are 
statistically just like giant frogs; however, they are often  
found in "drier" areas as they do not have to maintain a  
wet skin surface.
A giant frog can stretch its tongue out up to 15' and  
drag  up  to  dwarf-sized prey  to its  mouth;  on  every 
subsequent round, the victim is hit automatically.  On a

A  ghost  is  the  soul  or  spirit  of  a  deceased  sentient 
creature  that  has  for  some  reason  remained  on  the 
material plane.  They usually appear as they did in life,  
but sometimes the appearance of a ghost is altered by  
its  original  personality;  for  instance,  the  ghost  of  an 
angry  person  might  have  a  threatening  or  even  
demonic visage.  Ghosts are undead, and as such are  
immune to sleep, charm, and hold magic.
Seeing a ghost is so terrible that any living creature who  
does so must save vs. Spells or flee for 2d6 rounds.  
Anyone who successfully makes this save may not be  
so affected by that ghost again.
A ghost that hits a living target with its touch attack does 
1d8  points  of  damage,  and  at  the  same  time  
regenerates the same number of hit points.  In addition,  
the  victim  loses  1  Constitution  point.   Elves  and  
dwarves  (and  other  long-lived  creatures  such  as  
dragons) are allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to  
resist  this  effect,  which  must  be  rolled  on  each  hit. 
Characters who lose Constitution appear to have aged.  
If a ghost is fighting a living creature which does not  
have  a  Constitution  score,  the  GM  should  assign 
whatever score they see fit.
Like most incorporeal creatures, ghosts may normally  
be hit only by magical weapons.  However, if a ghost  
makes use of its touch attack, it becomes vulnerable to  
non-magical weapons until the beginning of the next  
round of combat.
Lost Constitution can be regained at a rate of one point  
per casting of restoration; nothing else (except a wish) 
can restore Constitution lost to a ghost . If a character's

Constitution falls to 0, they die permanently and cannot 
be raised (but still may be reincarnated).
Once per turn, a ghost can use telekinesis (as the spell) 
as if it were a 10th level Magic-User.
Instead of attacking, a ghost may attempt to possess a  
living creature. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell 
(as if cast by a 10th level Magic-User), except that it  
does not require a receptacle.  To use this ability, the  
ghost must be able to move into the target (so it is  
possible to avoid this attack by outrunning the ghost).  
The target can resist the attack with a successful save  
vs. Spells.  A creature that successfully saves is immune  
to being possessed by that ghost for 24 hours.  If the  
save  fails,  the  ghost  enters  the  target's  body  and 
controls it; control may be maintained until the ghost  
chooses to leave the victim's body, or until it is driven  
out by means of a  remove curse or  dispel evil spell.  
While it is possessing a living creature, a ghost may not  
use any of its special abilities.

Ghouls are  undead  monsters which eat the flesh of  
dead humanoids to survive.  They are vile, disgusting  
carrion-eaters, but are more than willing to kill for food.  
Those slain by ghouls will generally be stored until they  
begin to rot before the ghouls will actually eat them.
Living  creatures hit  by  a ghoul’s bite or claw attack  
must save vs. Paralysis or be paralyzed for 2d8 turns.  
Elves are immune to this paralysis.  Ghouls try to attack  
with surprise whenever possible, striking from behind  
tombstones or bursting from shallow graves; when they  
attack in this way, they are able to surprise opponents  
on 1-3 on 1d6. Like all undead, they may be Turned  
by Clerics and are immune to sleep, charm, and hold 
magics.
Humanoids  bitten  by  ghouls  may  be  infected  with 
ghoul fever.  Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a

5% chance of the infection being passed.  The afflicted  
humanoid is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; if the save  
is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.
An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a 
ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes  
a ghoul in this way retains none of the knowledge or  
abilities they possessed in life.  The newly-risen ghoul is  
not under the control of any other ghouls, but hungers  
for the flesh of the dead and behaves like any other  
ghoul in all respects.
Ghasts look and fight almost exactly like ghouls, but  
they are smarter and just a bit more powerful.  Refer to  
the  previous  paragraphs  for  information  about  their 
claw attacks and other abilities.
The stink of death and corruption surrounding these  
creatures is overwhelming. Living creatures within 10  
feet must succeed on a save vs. Poison or be sickened  
for  2d6  rounds  (-2  to  attack  rolls).  A  creature  that 
successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same  
ghast’s stench for 24 hours. A neutralize poison spell 
removes the effect from a sickened creature.
They may be Turned by Clerics using the same column  
as the ghoul, but as they are superior to ghouls, in a  
mixed group of ghasts and ghouls the GM should apply  
Turning effects to the ordinary ghouls first.
Humanoids bitten by ghasts may be infected with ghast  
fever. Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a 10%  
chance  of  the  infection  being  passed.  The  afflicted 
humanoid is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; if the save  
is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.
An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghast fever rises as a  
ghast at the next midnight, in a similar fashion to the  
ghoul. However, a humanoid who becomes a ghast in  
this way retains all of the knowledge and abilities they  
possessed  in  life,  unless  those  abilities  are  directly 
incompatible with the creature's new form (as decided  
by  the  GM).   For  such  ghasts,  the  GM  should also 
adjust  XP  values to include  any  such  abilities.   The 
newly-risen ghast is not under the control of any other  
ghasts,  but  hungers  for  the  flesh  of  the  living  and 
behaves like any other ghast in all respects.

Cloud giants are huge, with males averaging 18 feet tall  
and  females  17  feet  tall;  an  adult  cloud  giant  will 
normally weigh more than 4,750 pounds.  They have  
very pale skin, sometimes with a slight bluish tint, and  
their hair is bright metallic colors such as silver, brass, or 
even gold.  They have long lives, with most surviving to  
400 years barring disease or misadventure.
Cloud  giants are often vain, convinced they are  the  
highest form of creation.  They wear the finest clothing,  
make  and  eat  the  best  food  and  drink,  and  live  in 
castles built on high mountains or even in the clouds  
themselves.  Like most giants, they are suspicious of the 
smaller races, but cloud giants do not usually prey upon

them, preferring instead to demand tribute from smaller  
humanoids living nearby.
Despite being self-centered, they fight in highly trained  
units that use sound tactics; their belief in their own  
superiority  allows  no  less.   Attacking  from  above  is 
preferred,  and  ranged attacks  are  always considered 
better than melee.  To that end, cloud giants can throw  
large stones up to 200' for 3d6 points of damage each.  
Also, 5% of cloud giants have the abilities of a Magic-
User of level 2 to 8 (2d4).  A favorite tactic is to encircle  
enemies,  barraging  them  with  rocks while  the  giants 
with  magical  abilities confound  them with spells.  In  
battle,  cloud  giants  wear  finely  crafted,  intricately  
engraved plate mail.

A cyclops is a one-eyed giant.  Huge and brutish, they  
most resemble hill giants, and even dress in the same  
"style," layers of crudely prepared hides with the fur left  
on, unwashed and unrepaired.  They are reclusive and  
unfriendly to almost all of the smaller races.
A cyclops can throw a large rock up to 200' for 3d6  
points of damage, but they aim poorly and thus suffer  
an attack penalty of -2.  Once per year, a cyclops can  
cast the spell  bestow curse  (the reverse of the spell

Despite their great size, fire giants have a Dwarf-like  
appearance, being barrel-chested with thick arms and  
legs; average males stand 14 feet tall and weigh around  
3,200 pounds, while females average 13 feet tall and  
around 3,000 pounds.  Their skin is ruddy, their hair is  
black, and their eyes are a very dark red that is almost  
black (and looks that color in poor lighting).
Fire giants are unfriendly to almost all other humanoid  
races,  though  they  sometimes  subjugate  those  living 
nearby to act as their servants.
In combat they favor heavy plate steel armor (the first  
AC  given  above)  made  of  steel  blackened  by  
quenching in oil.  They arm themselves with massive  
weapons made of the same material.  A fire giant can  
throw large stones up to 200' for 3d6 points of damage.  
Fire giants are immune to all fire-based attacks.

Frost  giants have pale, almost  white skin, blonde  or  
pale blue hair, and bright blue eyes.  Average males  
stand 15 feet tall and weigh  around 2,800 pounds,  
while females average 14 feet tall and 2,500 pounds.
Frost  giants  are,  first  and  foremost,  cunning.   They 
dislike  the  smaller  races  as  much  as  any  giant,  but 
rather than attacking outright they will try to use their  
advantages  to  convince  those  weaker  than  them  to 
submit.  If faced with a stronger force, frost giants will  
parley or withdraw if possible, attacking only if victory  
seems assured.
In  combat  frost  giants  prefer  brightly-polished  steel 
chainmail worn over their customary clothing of leather  
and fur (the first AC given above), and weapons of the  
same material.  A frost giant can throw large stones up  
to 200'  for 3d6  points of  damage.  Frost  giants are  
immune to all ice or cold-based attacks.

The  smallest  of  giants,  
adult  hill  giants  stand  
between 10 and 12 feet in  
height  and  weigh  about  
1,100 pounds.  They have  
medium  brown  skin,  
though  they  are  often  so 
dirty as to hide their true  
skin  color;  their  hair  is  
dark,  lank,  and  greasy,  
and their  eyes are dark as  
well.   They  wear  crude  
clothing  made  of  leather; 
the  lack  of  livestock  or  
game of great enough size  
often results in whole pelts  
being stitched together.
Whether  attacking  with  a 
weapon or fist, hill giants deal 2d8 damage.  Hill giants  
are brutish and aggressive.  They are sometimes found  
leading groups of ogres or bugbears.  Hill giants often  
keep dire wolves as pets.

Mountain giants are the largest of all giants, with adult  
males averaging 24 feet in height and weighing around  
16,000 pounds.  Females are slightly smaller, standing  
22 feet tall on the average and weighing around 14,000 
pounds.  They look very much like enormous, thickly  
built hill giants, and among humans they are often seen  
as  little  more  than  that.   This  is  underselling  the  
mountain giants, however, for though their crafting is  
primitive  they  have  an  intricately  detailed  social  
structure.
Mountain giants live in clans, led by the oldest male and 
female (or by their oldest offspring if the elders choose  
to delegate leadership due to advanced age).  Each clan 
rules over and controls a group of 1d6 mountain peaks, 
generally spanning an area with a 5-6 mile diameter.  
They  prefer  peaks connected  by  high  ridges so  that 
they do not have to descend too far when walking their  
territory.   Clan  members  who  are  mated  establish 
households  within  the  territory;  unmarried  members 
typically live with their parents until they are wed.  The  
"lair"  encounter  figures  above  are  for  a  single  
household, but if one household is attacked and the  
attackers subsequently retreat, upon their return they  
will usually find much of the rest of the clan waiting for  
them in ambush.
They wear armor made of  wood held together with  
heavy rope, and wield giant clubs or staves carved from  
fully grown trees harvested from the lower reaches of  
their territory.  If they live near storm giants, they may  
trade  for better weapons (the second damage  rating  
given  above)  but  usually  cannot  afford  storm  giant 
armor.
A mountain giant can throw large stones up to 240' for  
4d6 points of damage each.

Stone giants are not the largest of giants, but with an  
average adult standing 12 feet tall and weighing roughly 
1,500 pounds they are still formidable.  There is no  
substantial  difference  in  height  between  males  and 
females.  They usually dress in heavy leather clothing  
with sections having been boiled to stiffen them; these  
outfits serve as armor and give them the first AC above. 
Stone giants are reclusive, but they will defend their  
territory (typically in rocky mountainous terrain) against  
any who trespass therein.
A stone giant can throw large stones up to 300' for 3d6  
points of damage.  They will fight in groups to defend  
their  territory  but  use  only  simple,  basic  tactics  and 
strategy.

Storm giants are nearly the largest of the giants, with  
adult males standing 21 feet tall and weighing around  
12,000  pounds;  adult  females  average  20  feet  and 
typically  weigh  around  11,000  pounds.   Most  storm 
giants  have  pale  skin  and  dark  hair,  but  some  
individuals have skin of a lavender color,  and some  
have pale white or silver hair.  Their eyes range from  
bright blue to deep gray in color.
They prefer to dress in light clothing, such as tunics,  
sandals, and so on, but in battle they wear finely-crafted 
plate mail armor of bright metal and wield weapons of  
the same sort.  Their equipment usually appears to be  
silver but those of the highest class or rank wear armor  
and bear arms of a bright and shining golden color.
Unlike  most  other  giants,  storm  giants  have  been 
known to befriend humans, elves, or dwarves.
Storm giants have the ability to throw lightning bolts 
as if they were  spears (which  work just  as the spell  
does, and can be used once per five rounds; a save vs.  
Spells reduces damage to half).  They prefer to attack  
first  with  lightning  before  moving  on to other  attack 
forms.  Not surprisingly, storm giants are resistant to all  
forms of lightning or electrical attack, suffering only half  
damage normal when so attacked.  
Also note that 10% of storm giants have the abilities of  
a Magic-User of level 2 to 12 (2d6).

Gnolls are large fur-covered humanoids, averaging 7½  
feet in height and weighing about 300 pounds.  They  
are  best  recognized  by  their  heads,  which  resemble 
those of hyenas (or perhaps wolves) but with shorter  
muzzles than either.
Gnolls are nocturnal and have Darkvision with a 30'  
range.  They are cruel carnivores, preferring intelligent  
creatures for food because they scream more.  They  
show little discipline when fighting unless they have a  
strong leader.

One out of every six gnolls will be a hardened warrior

Gnomes are humanoids distantly related to dwarves;  
they  have  a  similar  appearance,  but  are  smaller  
(averaging  3  to  3½  feet  tall  and  weighing  40  to  45 
pounds) and less stocky.  Their ears are pointed, not in  
as  pronounced  a  fashion  as  elves  but  certainly  
noticeable, and their noses likewise are pointed a bit  
more than those of most other kinds of humanoids.  
Their preferred habitat is the forest, preferably in a hilly  
temperate region.
They have Darkvision with a 30' range.  When attacked 
in melee by creatures larger than man-sized, gnomes  
gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class.  Outdoors in their 
preferred  forest  terrain  they  are  able  to  hide  very 
effectively; so long as they remain still there is only a  
20% chance they  will  be  detected.   If one  or more  
gnomes  who  are  successfully  hiding  attack  from  
ambush, they surprise their foes on 1-4 on 1d6.
Gnomes have their own language, and many also know 
the language of the dwarves.  Some gnomes make their 
living  as  traders,  often  acting  as  go-betweens  for  
dwarves and humans, and those gnomes naturally tend  
to  learn  Common.   Those  who  are  engaged  in  
defending  their  forest  settlements  from  humanoid  
incursions often choose to learn Goblin or Orc.
Gnomes encountered in the wilderness (who are not  
traders or merchants) are likely to be unfriendly, but not 
hostile.  They tolerate dwarves but dislike most other  
humanoid races.  When forced to interact with other  
races,  a  gnome  will  generally  be  recalcitrant,  unless 
offered a significant amount of treasure.
The  statistics  given  above  are  for  warriors.   In  a  
settlement  or lair, for every  warrior there will be an  
average  of  three  civilians  having  1-1  Hit  Dice  and 
Armor Class 11; such gnomes have Morale of 7.  One  
out of every eight gnome warriors will be a sergeant  
having 3 Hit Dice (145 XP).  Gnomes gain a +1 bonus  
to their morale if they are led by a sergeant.  Both  
warriors and sergeants commonly wear chainmail. In  
gnomish communities, one out of every sixteen warriors 
will be a captain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) with an Armor  
Class  of  16  (11),  adding  a  shield.   In  addition,  in 
communities of 35 or greater, there will be a king of 7  
Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor Class of 18 (11), in  
plate mail and carrying a shield, having a +1 bonus  
damage due to strength.  In their community, gnomes  
never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive.  
There  is  a  chance  equal  to  1-4  on  1d6  that  a  
community will have a Cleric of level 1d6+1, and 1-2  
on 1d6 of a Magic-User of level 1d6.  Gnomish Clerics  
use 1d6 hit dice and Magic-Users use 1d4 hit dice, and  
in  all  other  ways  behave  as  if  they  were  normal 
characters.

Goblins are small, reputedly wicked humanoids.  They  
are  cunning  and  vicious,  and  very  sneaky.   Adult 
goblins are 3 to 3½ feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds,  
with very little difference between males and females.  
Their skin color ranges from gray to green, and their  
eyes are usually bright and crafty-looking, varying in  
color from red to yellow.
All goblins have Darkvision with a 30' range.
The statistics given above are for a standard Goblin in  
leather  armor  with  a  shield;  they  have  a  natural

+2 bonus to morale while their king is present (this is  
not  cumulative  with  the  bonus  given  by  a  warrior 
leader).
In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a  
shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a goblin king is  
present).  A shaman is equivalent to a regular goblin  
statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.

Golem
Golems are a kind of construct, a creature created from  
non-living matter and animated by application of magic. 
The  powers  required  to  animate  a  golem  are  
prodigious,  and  involve  summoning,  capturing,  and 
binding  an elemental  spirit  to  the  constructed  body. 
This  process  also  binds  the  golem  to  the  will  of  its 
creator.
They  are  mindless,  and  thus  immune  to  magics  
affecting the mind such as sleep, charm, hold, and any 
form  of  mind reading  or  telepathy.  They  must  be  
given  explicit,  detailed  instructions  verbally,  and  the 
controller must be within 60 feet of the golem to do so.  
If not actively being commanded, a golem will follow  
the  last  instructions  given  to  it  until  the  controller 
returns.  If such a golem is attacked, it will fight in its  
own defense but will usually not pursue the attackers if  
they flee.  The controller can order the golem to follow  
the  commands  of  another,  but  can  always  resume 
control if desired (i.e. the controller's commands always  
take precedence).
Employing a golem in combat is tricky, for once one  
attacks an opponent there is a cumulative 1% chance  
each round (so 1% the first round, 2% the second, 3%  
the third, and so on) that the golem will stop following  
commands and become berserk.  Once this happens  
the golem will attack any creature in range, choosing  
targets randomly when there are more than one.  If all  
targets are killed or driven away the golem will move  
on,  looking  for  more  creatures  to  kill  and  breaking 
down any barrier that stands in its way if it is at all  
possible.
The  berserk  chance  for  a  golem  that  is  still  under 
control is reset to 0% only when the golem is inactive,  
neither attacking nor being attacked, for one full round.
The creator of the golem (but not any other person  
who might have been delegated control) may try to  
calm the golem, speaking firmly to it to convince it to  
stop.  The creator needs to succeed at a saving throw  
vs. Spells to do this, after spending a round talking to  
the golem.  If this roll fails the golem turns its attention  
to the  creator  and  pursues  them  with  single-minded 
hatred.
If a berserk golem is unable to attack anyone for 5  
rounds it resumes its inactive state, and the controller  
can again give it commands.  If it begins to pursue its  
creator, though, it will never stop no matter how long it  
takes, and must normally be trapped or destroyed to  
stop  it.   It  has  no  special  way  to  find  the  creator, 
however, and will become inactive if it loses sight of the  
creator  for  a  minimum  of  1  day.   If  the  golem  is 
successfully calmed, it can be given commands again  
on the very next round of combat.
As their bodies are made of non-living matter, golems  
can only be hit by magical weapons.  Conversely, they  
are less resistant to various effects due to the fact that  
they are not living creatures; in general, golems save as  
if they were Fighters of ½ their hit dice in levels.  For  
example, a Bone Golem has 8 hit dice, but saves as a  
Fighter of 4th level.

Amber golems are generally built to resemble lions or  
other  great  cats.   They  are  able  to  detect  invisible 
creatures or objects within 60', and can track with 95%  
accuracy through any terrain type.
A magical attack that deals electricity damage heals 1  
point of damage for every 3 full points of damage the  
attack would otherwise deal.  For example, an amber  
golem hit by a lightning bolt for 20 points of damage is 
instead healed up to 6 points.  If the amount of healing  
would cause the  golem to exceed its full  normal hit  
points, the excess is ignored.

Bone  golems are  huge  four-armed monsters  created 
from  the  skeletons of  at least  two  dead humanoids. 
Though  made  of  bone,  they  are  not  undead  and 
cannot be turned.
Instead of four one-handed weapons, a bone golem

These golems resemble statues made of bronze; unlike  
natural  bronze  statues,  they  never  turn  green  from 
verdigris.  A bronze golem is 10 feet tall and weighs  
about 4,500 pounds.  A bronze golem cannot speak or  
make  any  vocal  noise,  nor  does  it  have  any  
distinguishable odor.  It moves with a ponderous but  
smooth  gait.   Each  step causes the  floor  to tremble 
unless it is on a thick, solid foundation.
The  interior  of  a  bronze  golem  is  molten  metal.  
Creatures hit  by  one  in  combat  suffer  an additional 
1d10 points of damage from the heat (unless resistant  
to heat or fire).  If one is hit in combat, molten metal  
spurts out, spraying the attacker for 2d6 damage.  A  
save vs. Death Ray is allowed to avoid the metal spray.

Clay golems are made of clay, naturally, and thus may  
be any natural clay color; generally, one will be grayish  
in color, but common clay containing iron oxide may  
be used which results in a red, brown, or even orange  
clay golem.  They are usually unclad, but some golem-
makers choose to put a leather belt, girdle, or apron on  
their creation.  A clay golem weighs about 600 pounds.
Wounds inflicted by a clay golem do not heal normally;  
worse, magical healing cures only 1 point per die rolled  
(but add all bonuses normally).  Thus, a  cure light  
wounds spell heals just 2 points.

Flesh golems are horrible creations made of body parts  
from deceased humanoids (including all character races  
as  well  as  humanoid  monsters),  crudely  stitched  
together and animated by magic.  A flesh golem is 8  
feet tall and weighs about 450 pounds.
A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a 
flesh golem (as the reverse of the haste spell) for 2d6  
rounds, with no saving throw.  Attacks using lightning  
or electricity heal 1 point of damage per every 3 points  
the  attack  would  normally  inflict,  rounded  down;  
further, such an attack breaks any ongoing slow effect 
on the golem.  As usual, healing will not increase the  
monster above its normal hit points.  For example, a  
flesh golem hit by a  lightning bolt which should deal  
14 points of damage instead receives up to 4 points of  
healing.

Iron golems are huge, generally 11 to 12 feet in height  
with a weight of 4,500 to 5,500 pounds.  Such golems  
are usually fashioned like statues, and may appear to  
be  wearing  armor  and  armed  with  a  shortsword  or 
mace; the sculpting will often be simpler and cruder  
than that  done  by a real  sculptor.  Though  an iron  
golem has no voice, it is hardly silent when in motion,  
as its gentlest footstep on any hard surface shakes the  
floor and walls.  Note that, while an iron golem has little  
if  any  odor  normally,  when wet  they  have  a strong 
metallic smell detectable up to 60 feet away.
Iron golems can exhale a cloud of poisonous gas which  
fills a 10-foot cube and persists for 1 round.  Those  
within the area of effect must save vs. Dragon Breath or  
die.  This ability can be used up to 3 times per day.
A  magical  attack  that  deals  lightning  or  electrical  
damage  slows an iron golem  (as the  reverse of the  
haste  spell)  for  1d6  rounds,  with  no  saving  throw. 
Attacks using fire heal 1 point of damage per every 3  
points the attack would normally inflict, rounded down;  
further, such an attack breaks any ongoing slow effect  
on the golem.  As usual, healing will not increase the  
monster above its normal hit points.  For example, an  
iron golem hit by a fireball which should deal 17 points  
of damage instead receives up to 5 points of healing.  
An iron golem is affected by rust attacks such as that of  
a rust monster, suffering 2d6 points of damage for each

Stone golems are quite large, normally being about 8 to

These golems are usually fashioned like statues, and  
may appear to be wearing armor and armed with a  
shortsword or mace; the sculpting will often be simpler  
and cruder than that done by a real sculptor.
Once every other round a stone golem has the ability to 
cast a  slow effect, as the reverse of the  haste spell; a  
save vs. Spells is allowed to resist.  This effect lasts for  
2d6 rounds and has an effective range of just 10 feet.
A  stone to flesh  spell may be used to weaken the  
monster.   The  spell  does  not  actually  change  the  
golem’s structure, but for one  full  round  after being  
affected, the golem is vulnerable to normal weapons.  
The stone golem is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist  
this effect.

Petrify is allowed to resist.
An adult male (bull) gorgon weighs up to 4,500 pounds

up to 9 feet long.  Females (cows) will be a bit smaller,  
perhaps no more than 6 feet at the shoulder and 8 feet

their combat statistics are much the same as the males.  
Any group of more than one gorgon will consist of one

Griffons  are  large  carnivorous  creatures  resembling 
lions  with  the  head,  foreclaws  and  wings  of  eagles. 
Average adults (male or female) have a wingspan of  
around 22 feet and weigh around 500 pounds.
Griffons nest on high mountaintops, soaring down to  
feed on horses, the beast’s preferred prey.  Indeed, a  
griffon will attack a horse over anything else.  They hunt 
and travel in flocks, diving low when attacking to swipe  
with their claws.  They are not above retreating and  
then returning when they may be unexpected.
Griffons can be trained as mounts if raised in captivity,  
but even in this case they may try to attack horses if any 
come within about 120'.  Roll a morale check in this  
case; if the check is failed, the griffon will try to attack  
immediately.  A light load for a griffon is up to 400

arranged evenly around  the tree  in most  cases,  and  
generally no more than one limb can attack any single  
creature at a time.
The roots of this tree are also animated; they do not  
attack, but they do pull dead bodies below the surface  
of the ground for "digestion."

A harpy looks like a giant vulture bearing the torso and  
face of a human female.  They are able to attack with  
their claws as well as with a normal weapon, but they  
are most feared for the power of their song by which  
they  are able to charm  living creatures, and, having  
charmed them, tear them to pieces at their leisure.
All living creatures within a 300' range of one or more  
singing harpies must make a save vs. Spells or become  
charmed.   The  same  harpy’s  song  cannot  affect  a 
creature that successfully saves again for 24 hours.  This 
charm is very powerful, such that a victim will approach  
the  harpy  or  harpies  without  fear  with  a  dazed  
expression on its face.  If the victim is led toward some  
danger, such as a ravine, fire, or the like, a second  
saving throw is allowed immediately; however, if this  
save fails the victim will proceed directly into danger.
Once  in  reach  of  a  harpy,  a  charmed  victim  will 
surrender completely, even allowing the harpy to attack  
and kill it without putting up any sort of resistance.  The  
charm effect lasts one full round after all harpies have

Hellhounds  are  large  canine  creatures  sheathed  in 
hellish flame; they range in size from 3 to 5 feet at the  
shoulder (3 feet for a 3 hit die monster, plus ½ foot for  
each additional hit die) with a weight ranging from 100  
to  200  pounds  (100  pounds  at  3  hit  dice  plus  25 
pounds  per additional  hit  die).   These  monsters are 
native  to  another  plane  where  they  hunt  in  packs; 
sometimes  powerful  wizards  or  evil  priests  summon 
them for use as watchdogs.  In addition to biting, each  
hellhound may breathe fire a number of times per day  
equal to its hit dice.  In combat, one-third of the time  
(1-2 on 1d6) a hellhound will choose to breathe fire;  
otherwise it will attempt to bite.  Roll each round to  
determine which attack form will be used.
A hellhound's breath weapon is a cone of flame 10'  
wide at the far end which is 10' long for those with 3 or  
4 hit dice, 20' long for those with 5 or 6 hit dice, and  
30' long for the largest hellhounds.  This breath weapon 
does 1d6  points  of  damage  per each  hit  die  of  the 
hellhound to all within the area of effect; a successful  
saving throw vs. Dragon Breath reduces damage to half  
normal.
Note that hellhounds vary with regard to the number of  
hit dice each has.  If generating a group randomly, roll  
1d6+1 for the hit dice of each, reading a total of 2 as 3.

variety of colors and patterns, including white, black,  
tan, brown, and reddish brown with markings such as  
blazes, stripes, stars, "bald" faces, and so on.
A  hippogriff  avoids the  territories  and  civilizations  of 
other creatures, dwelling in extreme altitudes.  Griffons 
sometimes  prey  upon  them,  and  hippogriffs  will  
generally  attack  griffons  on  sight  if  they  have  a  
numerical advantage.
Hippogriffs are omnivorous, entering combat only as  
defense, save for those times a griffon is met.  They are  
prized as flying mounts since, unlike griffons, they are  
relatively  safe  around  horses;  note  that  it  is  still  
necessary to raise one in captivity in order to use it as a  
mount.   A  light  load  for  a  hippogriff  is  up  to  400

Hobgoblins are, basically, man-sized goblins.  They are  
better organized than their smaller kin,  and are also  
better adapted to life in the sun.  Their skin tone ranges  
from a greenish tan to a grayish brown, and their hair  
and eyes are usually dark.  Most wear toughened hides  
and carry  wooden  shields for armor.  As with most  
goblinoids, they have Darkvision with a 30' range.
Tribes of hobgoblins prefer to live in walled villages, or  
preferably in castles, and are quite willing to overrun  
villages or castles built by other races rather than build  
their own.  Some tribes do choose to live underground.  
Hobgoblins have a well-known hatred of elves, and will  
attack them whenever they think they can win.
One out of every six hobgoblins will be a warrior of 3  
Hit  Dice  (145  XP).   Regular  hobgoblins  gain  a  +1 
bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior.  In  
hobgoblin  lairs,  one  out  of  every  twelve  will  be  a 
chieftain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) in chainmail with an  
Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 20', having  
a +1 bonus to damage due to strength.  In lairs of 30 or  
more there will be a hobgoblin  
king  of  7  Hit  Dice  (670  XP), 
with a shield for an Armor Class 
of 16 (11) having a +2 bonus to 
damage.  In the lair, hobgoblins  
never  fail  a  morale  check  as 
long  as  the  king  is  alive.   In 
addition,  a  lair  has  a  chance 
equal  to  1-2  on  1d6  of  a  
shaman  being  present  (or  1-3 
on 1d6  if  a hobgoblin king is  
present),  and  1  on  1d6  of  a 
witch or warlock.  A shaman is  
equivalent  to  a  hobgoblin  
warrior  statistically,  but  has

Hydras  are  reptilian  creatures  with  multiple  heads. 
They  are  bad-tempered  and  territorial,  but  not  
particularly cunning.
The Armor Class and Hit Dice of a hydra are keyed to  
the  number  of  heads;  specifically,  a  hydra  has  a 
number of Hit Dice exactly  equal to the number of  
heads, and an Armor Class equal to the number of  
heads plus 11.  Note that these statistics do not change  
if an individual loses heads, as described below.
A hydra may be slain by damage in the normal fashion;  
however, most who fight them choose to strike at their

heads.  If a character using a melee weapon chooses to  
strike at a particular head (i.e. states such intent to the  
GM) and succeeds in doing 8 points of damage, that  
head is disabled (severed or severely damaged) and will 
not  be  able  to attack  anymore.   Such  damage  also 
applies to the monster's total hit points, of course.
Some  hydras  live  in  the  ocean;  use  the  given  
movement as a swimming rate rather than walking in  
this case.  A very few hydras can breathe fire; those that 
have this ability can emit a flame 10' wide and 20' long  
one time per head per day.  This attack will be used  
about one time in three (1-2 on 1d6) if it is available;  
roll for each head which is attacking.  Each such attack  
does  3d6  damage,  with  a  save  vs.  Dragon  Breath 
reducing the amount by half.  Note that the XP value of  
a fire-breathing hydra should be higher; treat them as if  
they have a single asterisk (i.e. add the special ability  
bonus to the base XP for the monster).

Hyenas are doglike carnivores who exhibit some of the  
behaviors of canines but are not related.  They not only  
hunt  but  also  scavenge  and  steal  meals.   A  hungry 
hyena  will  chew  on  anything  that  is  even  remotely 
tainted by blood, meat or other food traces.  They will  
mostly be found in the same savanna-like environments 
where lions and zebras may be found.  They can live in  
clans of up to a hundred individuals, though smaller  
groups  are  more  common.   They  are  among  the 
favorite pets of gnolls, who may take them into regions  
where they are not normally found.
Hyenodon  refers  to  ancient  four-legged  predators  
whose name means "hyena tooth."  While they are not  
technically hyenas, the statistics given may be used for  
the giant prehistoric hyena varieties as well; likewise,  
some  varieties  of  hyenodon  were  smaller,  and  the

An insect swarm is not a single creature; rather, it is a  
large group of ordinary flying or crawling insects moving 
as a unit.  In general, a swarm fills a volume equal to  
three 10' cubes, though it is possible for a swarm to  
become  more  compact  in  order  to  move  through  a 
small  doorway  or  narrow  corridor.   If  the  swarm  
consists of crawling insects, it covers three 10' squares  
and the flying movement above is ignored.
Any living creature within the volume or area of the  
swarm  suffers  1d3  points  of  damage  each  round. 
Damage rolls are doubled if the victim is unarmored  
(for creatures which do not wear armor, any creature  
having less than AC 15 is considered unarmored).
Damage is reduced to a single point per round for three  
rounds if the character manages to exit the swarm.  It is  
possible to "ward off" the insects by swinging a weapon, 
shield, or other similar-sized object around, and in this  
case damage is likewise reduced to 1 point per round.  
If a lit torch is used in this way, the swarm takes 1d4  
points of damage per round.  Weapons, even magic  
weapons,  do not  harm an insect swarm.   An entire  
swarm can be affected by a sleep spell.  Smoke can be  
used to drive a swarm away (if the swarm moves away  
from  any  victims  due  to  smoke,  the  damage  stops 
immediately).  Finally, a victim who dives into water will 
take damage for only one more round.

Invisible Stalker
Armor Class: 19
Hit Dice: 8*
No. of Attacks: 1

Invisible stalkers are monsters from another plane of  
existence who may be summoned to slay the enemies  
of a wizard or to perform some other simple task.  They  
are  naturally  invisible,  and  remain  so  even  after  
attacking.
A  summoned  invisible  stalker  does  whatever  the  
summoner commands, even if the task takes days or  
weeks  to  perform.   The  creature  is  compelled  to  
complete the task regardless of time required.  Invisible  
stalkers don't like tasks that take too long or are too  
complicated, and if assigned an unwanted task will try  
to find a loophole or otherwise subvert the summoner's  
command.
An invisible stalker's form is amorphous, such that a  
detect invisible  spell shows only an undulating blob-
shaped  outline.   Don't  forget  to  apply  the  standard 
penalty of -4 on the attack die when an invisible stalker  
is attacked by a creature which is unable to see it.
Ironbane
Armor Class: 15
Hit Dice: 3*
No. of Attacks: 1 touch
Damage: Rust, see below
Movement: 50'

An ironbane resembles a large armadillo in its overall  
body plan, but has an anteater-like snout with a long  
flicking tongue, and long, strangely hare-like back legs  
which  allow  it  to  hop  from  place  to  place.   When 
attacking  or pursuing,  the  ironbane  stands up on its  
hind legs, but when resting or moving slowly it folds  
them and walks on all four feet.
Like the more common rust monster (as found on page  
139),  the  touch  of  any  part  of  an  ironbane's  body 
transforms metal objects into rust (or verdigris, or other  
oxides as appropriate).  Non-magical metal attacked by  
an ironbane, or that touches the monster (such as a  
sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined.  A non-

magical metal weapon used to attack the monster does  
half damage before being destroyed.  Magic weapons  
or armor lose one "plus" each time they make contact  
with the ironbane; this loss is permanent.
The metal oxides created by this monster are its food;  
thus, a substantial amount of metal dropped in its path  
may  cause  it  to  cease  pursuit  of  metal-armored  
characters.  Use a morale check to determine this.
Metals that do not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of 
no interest to an ironbane and will be ignored.  Silver  
and  copper  on  the  other  hand  are  candy  for  this 
creature  and  one  will  pursue  the  tastiest-smelling  
adventurer in any party.

These great cats are about 8 to 9 feet long (from nose  
to tail-tip) and weigh about 165 pounds.  Unlike other  
great cats, they enjoy swimming and often hunt near  
rivers or lakes.  Jaguars kill with their powerful bite,  
preferring to deliver a fatal wound to the skull of their  
prey.
Jelly
Jellies  are  strange  creatures  made  of  amorphous  
protoplasm.   They  are  similar  to  tiny  single-celled  
creatures such as a few wizards may have studied using  
magic, but far larger.  Jellies are always completely non-
intelligent, and are thus immune  to  sleep  or  charm 
magic  as  well  as  any  form  or  mind  reading  or 
telepathy.  Generally they also do not check morale,  
but simply move toward any potential meal and attack  
automatically.
Jelly, Black (Black Pudding)
Armor Class: 14
Hit Dice: 10* (+9)
No. of Attacks: 1 pseudopod
Damage: 3d8
Movement: 20'
No. Appearing: 1
Save As: Fighter: 10
Morale: 12
Treasure Type: None

Black jellies are non-intelligent creatures made of ooze,  
which will attack any creatures they encounter, sensing  
them by their warmth and possibly scent.   The entire  
body of one exudes acid, which is the source of the  
damage their attacks cause, and they fight by extending  
pseudopods to strike at their prey.
If attacked with normal or magical weapons, or with  
lightning or electricity, a black jelly suffers no injury, but  
will be split into two jellies; the GM should divide the  
original creature's hit dice between the two however  
they see fit, with the limitation that neither jelly may  
have less than two hit dice.  A two hit die black jelly is  
simply unharmed by such attacks, but cannot be split  
further.
Cold or ice based attacks do not harm a black jelly, but  
such an attack will paralyze the jelly for one round per  
die of damage the attack would normally cause.  Other  
attack  forms  will  affect  a  black  jelly  normally;  the 
preferred method of killing one usually involves fire.
