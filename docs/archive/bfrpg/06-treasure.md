nothing from their previous life, though a few very close 
friends or loved ones might be recalled (and hated, and  
possibly hunted by the monster).
Like all undead, wights may be Turned by Clerics and  
are immune to sleep, charm, and hold magics.  Wights 
are harmed only by silver or magical weapons, and take 
only half damage from burning oil.

The wolf is a large canine found in a broad range of  
habitats.  They travel in packs consisting of a mated pair 
accompanied  by  their  offspring.   Wolves  are  also  
territorial,  and  fights  over  territory  are  among  the 
principal causes of wolf mortality. The wolf is mainly a  
carnivore and feeds on large wild hoofed mammals as  
well as smaller animals, livestock, and carrion.
Dire wolves are huge relatives of the ordinary wolves,  
being as large as horses.  They live and hunt in packs,  
and  are  sometimes  tamed  by  smaller  humanoids  as 
battle steeds or by larger ones as pets.

Wraiths are fearsome incorporeal monsters who drain  
the  very  life  energy  from  their  victims.   Being  
incorporeal, they are immune to non-magical weapons  
and  are  effectively  flying  at  all  times.   They  are  
semitransparent and exude the same kind of coldness  
as wights.  Wraiths usually appear as they were in life,  
including such things as clothing or armor, though such  
things do not affect the monsters actual armor class or  
other statistics.
Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are 
immune to  sleep,  charm, and  hold magics.  Due to  
their  incorporeal  nature,  they  cannot  be  harmed  by 
non-magical weapons.

Wyvern
Armor Class: 18
Hit Dice: 7*
No. of Attacks: 1 bite, 1 stinger or 2 talons, 1 stinger
Damage: 2d8 bite, 1d6 + poison sting, 
1d10 talon
Movement: 30' (10') Fly 80' (15')
No. Appearing: Wild 1d6, Lair 1d6
Save As: Fighter: 7
Morale: 9

XP: 735
Wyverns are large dragon-like monsters, though they  
are built more like bats than lizards, having two legs and 
two wings; contrast this with true dragons, which have  
four  legs  and  two  wings.   They  are  of  animal  
intelligence,  but  are  excellent  predators  with  good 
hunting abilities.
Wyverns are aggressive and always hungry, and will  
attack almost anything smaller than themselves.  Any  
living creature hit by the wyvern's stinger must save vs.  
Poison or die.  Wyverns can only use their talons to  
attack when landing or flying past an enemy; while on  
the ground they may only bite and sting.  Further, a  
wyvern may not bite when flying past an opponent.  
The only situation in which all attacks can be made is  
when the monster is landing.
If a wyvern hits with both its talons, it may attempt to  
carry off its victim; victims weighing 300 pounds or less  
can be carried off, and the wyvern can only carry a  
victim for at most 6 rounds.  While flying with a victim,  
the wyvern cannot make any further attacks against it,  
but of course if the victim makes a nuisance of itself  
(such as by injuring the wyvern), it may be dropped.

Yellow Mold
Armor Class: Can always be hit
Hit Dice: 2* 
No. of Attacks: Spore cloud (1/day)
Damage: Choking, see below
Movement: 0
No. Appearing: 1d8
Save As: Normal Man
Morale: N/A
Treasure Type: None
XP: 100
If disturbed, a patch of this mold will discharge a cloud  
of  toxic  spores.   Each  patch  covers  from  10  to  25 
square feet; several patches may grow adjacent to each  
other, and will appear to be a single patch in this case.  
Each patch can emit a cloud of spores once per day.  
All within 10 feet of the mold will be affected by the  
spores and must save vs. Death Ray or take 1d8 points  
of damage per round for 6 rounds.  Brief exposure to  
sunlight makes a patch of yellow mold dormant, while  
longer exposures kills it.
Zombie
Armor Class: 12 (see below)
Hit Dice: 2
No. of Attacks: 1 bludgeon or 1 weapon
Damage: 1d8 or by weapon
Movement: 20'
No. Appearing: 2d4, Wild 4d6
Save As: Fighter: 2
Morale: 12
Treasure Type: None
XP: 75
Zombies  are  the  undead corpses  of  humanoid  
creatures.   They  are  deathly  slow,  but  they  move 
silently, are very strong and must be literally hacked to  
pieces to "kill" them.  They take only half damage from  
blunt weapons, and only a single point from arrows,  
bolts  or  sling  stones  (plus  any  magical  bonus).   A 
zombie never has Initiative and always acts last in any  
given round.
As zombies are strong and do not feel pain, they can  
bludgeon  enemies  with  both  fists  for  1d8  points  of 
damage.   However,  their  creators  often  arm  them, 
either  for  greater  damage  (as  with  a  greatsword  or 
polearm) or simply for effect.
Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are 
immune to  sleep,  charm, and  hold magics.  As they  
are mindless, no form of  mind reading  is of any use  
against them.  Zombies never fail morale checks, and  
thus always fight until destroyed.

Zombraire (and Skeletaire)
Zombraire Skeletaire
Armor Class: 12 (see below) 13 (see below)
Hit Dice: 2* (variable) 1* (variable)

Damage: 1d4 or per spell 1d4 or per spell

A Zombraire is a free-willed undead Magic-User.  Like  
the zombie it resembles, a zombraire moves silently, is  
very strong, and must be literally hacked to pieces to be  
destroyed.  However, it does not suffer the initiative  
penalty common to ordinary zombies.  It takes only half 
damage from blunt weapons, and only a single point  
from arrows, bolts, and sling stones (plus any magical  
bonus).  It may be Turned by a Cleric (as a wight), and  
is immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells.
A zombraire slowly rots away, and as it does it loses its  
sanity; this is represented by the variable morale listed.  
An insane zombraire fights to the death in hopes of  
being slain, thus ending its tortured existence.
The given statistics are for a zombraire formed from a  
2nd-level Magic-user; the HD and saving throws of a  
zombraire  are  based  on  the  level  it  had  in  life.   A 
zombraire  can  cast  spells  as  it  did  when  living,  but 
cannot learn new spells.
A Skeletaire is the final form of a zombraire which has  
rotted away completely.  It takes only half damage from  
edged weapons, and only a single point from arrows,  
bolts, and sling stones (plus any magical bonus).  It can  
be Turned by a Cleric (as a zombie), and is immune to  
sleep, charm, and hold spells.  A skeletaire never fails  
morale, and thus always fights until destroyed.
The statistics above are for a skeletaire formed from a  
2nd-level Magic-user.  A skeletaire will have HD equal  
to the  character's  level  minus  1,  and  will  save  as a 
Magic-user of the level equal to its HD.  The skeletaire  
cannot speak, but still retains the ability to prepare and  
cast spells as it did in life (but like a zombraire, it cannot  
learn new spells).
The process of creating or becoming a zombraire are  
variable,  and  often  involve  cursed  magic  items  
(especially cursed scrolls).

BASIC FANTASY RPG TREASURE
PART 7:  TREASURE
"Your idea was good, Darion," said Morningstar after we had turned the sarcophagus lid halfway around.  "You  
just got in a bit of a hurry to try it."
"Indeed," I said, feeling foolish.  I looked into the sarcophagus; lying atop the mummified remains inside I saw a  
sword, held in both bony hands with the point toward the corpse's feet.  The golden blade was untarnished; the  
huge ruby set into the cross-guard shone in the torchlight.
I didn't reach for it, though I found myself sorely tempted.  "Barthal," I said, "tell me, is it safe to reach within?"  
The Halfling climbed up onto the edge of the platform and leaned over the sarcophagus, peering around within.
"I don't see a trap," he remarked after careful study.  "Do you think the dead one, there, will rise up if you touch  
his sword?"
"He might," answered Apoqulis, "but I doubt it.  The skeletons were likely the only guardians in this tomb."
All eyes seemed to be on me.  Reluctantly I reached within, grasping the sword by the blade with my mailed  
glove so as to avoid touching the corpse.  The long-dead chieftain didn't want to part with his weapon, but after a  
bit of twisting I worked it loose.
Shaking bits of desiccated flesh from the hilt, I grasped the weapon properly and held it aloft.  It felt good in my  
hand… I wondered what magic it might contain?
Barthal's voice shook me out of my contemplation.  "Look here!" he said, and I looked down.  He had opened a  
secret panel in the platform… and as I looked on, gold and silver coins began to spill out.  Barthal cried out  
gleefully, "Jackpot!"
Distribution of Treasure
Some adventurers choose to adventure to battle evil,  
while others seek to attain glory or power… but others  
go in search of treasure, gold and jewels and magical  
items.  Below is the information the Game Master will  
need to satisfy the greedy.
Random Treasure Generation
The tables below describe the various  treasure types  
assigned to monsters, as well as unguarded treasures  
appropriate to various dungeon levels.  To generate a  
random treasure, find the indicated treasure type and  
read across; where a percentage chance is given, roll  
percentile dice to see if that sort of treasure is found.  If  
so, roll the indicated dice to determine how much.
Tables for the random generation of gems, jewelry (and  
bejeweled art pieces), and magic items are provided  
after the main treasure tables.
Placed Treasures
The Game Master is never required to roll for treasure;  
rather, treasure may be placed, or random treasures  
amended, as desired or needed for the purposes of the  
adventure.   Special  treasures  are  always  placed;  for 
example, a special magic item needed to complete an  
adventure.
Adjusting Treasure Awards
There  will  be  many  cases  where  random  treasure 
generation  is  not  the  best  method  to  employ.   For 
instance, a larger than average treasure assigned to a  
smaller than average lair of monsters might need to be  
reduced.  It is up to the Game Master to decide how  
much treasure they wish to allow into the campaign.  
Too  much  gold  (or  other  treasure  which  can  be 
converted to gold) may make things too easy for the  
player characters.  Similarly, too many magic items may 
also make things too easy.
If you are a novice Game Master, remember that you  
can always give more treasure, but it can be difficult to  
drain  treasure  from  the  party  without  angering  the 
players…  particularly  if  you  use  heavy-handed  
methods.   Start  small,  and  work  up  as  you  gain  
experience.

Gems and Jewelry
Use the tables below to determine the base value and  
number found when gems are indicated in a treasure  
hoard.   If  the  number  generated  in  the  main  table 
above is small, roll for each gem; but if the number is  
large (10 or more, at the GM's option), after each roll  
for Type and Base Value, roll the indicated die to see  
how many such gems are in the hoard.

The values of gems vary from the above for reasons of

adjust the  values of the  gems in the hoard,  at their  
option.  This is why there is no die result given in the

Explanation of Magic Items
Using Magic Items
Magic items may work in many different ways.  Some  
wearable items are activated just by putting them on.  
The effect of such items may not be known until an  
appropriate situation arises.  For example, the benefits  
of magic armor only become clear when the wearer is  
attacked.
Many items are activated by using them in an obvious  
fashion.  For instance, a character has to drink a potion, 
swing a sword, or interpose a shield to deflect a blow in  
combat.   Activation  of  these  items  is  generally  
straightforward  and  self-explanatory.   This  doesn’t  
mean that if you use such an item, you automatically  
know what  it can do;  many times, the only  way to  
know what an item does is to use it.
If no activation method is suggested either in the magic  
item description or by the nature of the item, assume  
that  a  command  word  is  needed  to  activate  it.  
Command  word  activation  means  that  a  character 
speaks  the  word  and  the  item  activates.   No  other 
special knowledge is usually needed.
A command word can be a real word, but when this is  
the  case,  the  holder  of  the  item  runs  the  risk  of 
activating the item accidentally by speaking the word in  
normal conversation.  More often, the command word  
is  some  seemingly  nonsensical  word,  or  a  word  or 
phrase from an ancient language no longer in common  
use.  Note that many magic items must be held in the  
hand (or otherwise specially handled or worn) to be  
used; the risk of accidental activation is less significant  
for such items.
Learning the command word for an item may be easy  
(sometimes the word is actually inscribed on the item)  
or  it  may  be  difficult,  requiring  the  services  of  a 
powerful  wizard  or  sage,  or  some  other  means  of 
discovery.
Only the character holding  or wearing a magic  item  
may activate it.  A character who has been gagged or  
silenced may not activate a magic item which requires a  
command word.
When an article  of magic  armor,  clothing  or jewelry  
(including a ring) is discovered, size is not usually an  
issue.   Such  items  magically  adjust  themselves  for 
wearers  from  as  small  as  Halflings  to  as  large  as 
Humans.  This effect is called  accommodation.  The  
GM may create "primitive" items lacking this power if  
they wish.
Generally only one magical item of a given type may be 
worn at the same time.  For example, a character can  
normally  only  wear  one  suit  of  armor,  wear  one 
necklace and carry one shield at a time. In the case of  
rings, a character may wear one magical ring per hand.  
If a character wears more items of a given type than  
would normally be practical, the items will usually fail to  
function  due  to  interference  with  one  another;  for 
instance, wearing two rings on the same hand normally  
results in both rings failing to operate.  Note, however, 
that  this limitation cannot  be used to disable  cursed  
magic items.  For example, wearing a cursed ring would 
prevent another magic ring from being worn and used  
on that  hand,  but  the  curse  would  not  be  lifted by 
donning a second magic ring.

Magic Weapons
Magic weapons are created with a variety of powers  
and will usually aid the wielder in combat.  A magical  
weapon's bonus is applied to all attack and damage  
rolls made with the weapon.
Casts Light on Command:   By drawing the weapon  
and uttering a command word, the wielder may cause it 
to glow; it will then shed light with the same radius as a  
light spell.  Sheathing or laying down the weapon, or  
speaking the command word again, dispels the effect.  
This power may be used as often as desired.
Charm Person: This power allows the wielder to cast  
charm  person once  per  day  by  brandishing  the 
weapon, speaking a command word and gazing at the  
target creature.  (The wielder's gaze does not have to be 
met for the spell to be cast.)  The target creature is  
allowed  saving  throws  just  as  described  in  the  spell 
description.
Drains Energy:  A weapon with this power drains one  
life energy level on a hit, as described under  Energy 
Drain in the  Encounter section; up to 2d4 levels can  
be drained by a weapon with this power, after which  
time the weapon loses this power but retains any other  
magical effects or bonuses.
Flames on Command:   Upon command, the weapon  
will be sheathed in fire.  The fire does not harm the  
wielder.  The effect remains until the command is given  
again,  or  until  the  weapon  is  dropped  or  sheathed. 
While  it  flames,  all  damage  done  by  the  weapon  is 
treated as fire damage, and an additional +1 bonus (in  
addition to the weapon's normal bonus) is added to  
damage when fighting trolls, treant, and other creatures  
especially vulnerable to fire.  It casts light and burns just  
as if it were a torch.
Locate Objects:  This power allows the wielder to cast  
the spell  locate object  once per day, as if by an 8 th 
level Magic-User.
Special Enemy: These weapons are created to combat  
a  specific  sort  of  creature,  as  rolled  on  the  Special 
Ability table.  When used against that specific enemy,  
the second listed bonus applies instead of the first; so a  
Sword +1, +3 vs. Undead  would provide +1 attack  
and  damage  against  giant  rats,  but  +3  attack  and 
damage rolls against zombies.
Wishes: Weapons with this power have the ability to  
grant 1d4 wishes.  The GM must adjudicate all wishes,  
and instructions are given in the Game Master section 
regarding this.  After these wishes have been made, the  
weapon loses this power, but retains any other bonuses  
and powers.
Cursed Weapons inflict a penalty to the wielder's attack 
rolls, as rolled on the Weapon Bonus table.  The curse  
causes the afflicted character to be unable to get rid of  
the weapon.  There are two possible forms the curse  
may  take:  Obsession  and  Affliction.   The  GM  may 
decide which to use at their option.
Obsession:   Regardless of how severe the penalty is,  
the character wielding the weapon will believe it is a  
bonus and refuse to use any other weapon in combat.  
A remove curse spell is the only way to rid a character  
of such a weapon; but as they will believe the weapon  
is the best magical weapon ever, the character receives  
a saving throw vs. Spells to resist.
Affliction:  The character knows the weapon is cursed  
as soon as they use it in combat; however, any attempt  
to throw it away fails, as the weapon magically appears  
back in the character's hand whenever they try to draw  
any other weapon.  In this case, the remove curse spell 
needed  to  rid  the  character  of  the  weapon  will  be 
unopposed (i.e. no saving throw).

Magic Armor
Magic  armor  (including  shields)  offers  improved,  
magical protection to the wearer.  In general, magic  
armor grants the normal Armor Class for its type, plus  
the magical armor bonus, as rolled on the Magic Armor  
table; for example, Plate Mail +2 provides an Armor  
Class of 19.
There  are  two  varieties  of  cursed  armor:   Cursed  
Armor -1 and Cursed Armor AC 11.  The first variety's  
AC is reduced by the rolled penalty; for example, Plate  
Mail -1 grants Armor Class 16.  The second type is  
much worse, for regardless of the type, it only provides  
Armor  Class  11.   Dexterity  and  shield  bonuses  still 
apply.
Cursed  armor  cannot  be  removed  from  the  wearer 
once the curse is proven, that is, once the wearer is hit  
in  combat.  Once  the  curse  has taken  effect,  only  a 
remove  curse spell,  or  some  more  powerful  magic 
(such as a  wish), will enable the wearer to remove it.  
The armor will detect as magical, like any other magic  
armor;  the curse  cannot  be  detected by  any  means 
other than wearing the armor in combat.
Potions
A potion is an elixir concocted with a spell-like effect  
that affects only the drinker.  Unless otherwise noted, a  
potion grants its benefits for 1d6+6 turns (even if the  
duration  of  an associated spell  is longer or  shorter).  
Potions generally only affect living creatures.
Clairaudience:  This potion enables the drinker to hear 
sounds  in  another area  through  the  ears  of  a  living 
creature in that area, up to a maximum 60' away.  This  
effect otherwise functions just as the spell clairvoyance.
Clairvoyance:  This potion grants the imbiber the effect 
of the clairvoyance spell.
Cold Resistance:   This potion grants the imbiber the  
power of the spell resist cold.
Control Animal:  This potion functions like a control  
human  potion,  but  affects  only  normal,  non-magical 
animals.
Control Dragon:  This potion functions like a control  
human potion, but affects only dragons.
Control Giant:   This potion  functions like  a control  
human potion, but affects only giants.
Control Human:   This  potion  allows  the  drinker  to 
charm  any  humanoid  by  gazing  at  it.  The  effect  
functions like the charm person spell.  If the charm is  
resisted, the drinker can attempt to charm up to two  
more targets before the potion’s benefit is exhausted.
Control Plant:  This potion grants the drinker control  
over one or more plants or plant creatures within a 10'  
square area up to 50' away.  Normal plants become  
animated, having a movement rate of 10', and obey the 
drinker's  commands.   If  ordered  to  attack,  only  the 
largest plants can do any real harm, attacking with a +0  
attack bonus and inflicting 1d4 points of damage per  
hit.  Affected plant creatures (who fail to save vs. Spells) 
can understand the drinker, and behave as if under a  
charm monster spell.
Control  Undead:  This  potion  grants  the  drinker  
command of 3d6 hit dice of undead monsters.  A save  
vs.  Spells  is  allowed  to  resist  the  effect.   Mindless 
undead follow the  drinker's commands exactly;  free-
willed undead act as if under a charm person spell.
Delusion:  This cursed potion will appear, if tested or  
analyzed, to be one of the other potions (other than  
poison).  When imbibed, the drinker will briefly believe  
they have received the benefits of the "other" potion,  
but the illusion will be swiftly exposed…
Diminution: This potion  reduces the drinker and all  
items worn or carried to one-twelfth of their original  
height (so that a 6' tall character becomes 6" tall).  The  
drinker's  weight  is  divided  by  1,728;  this  makes  an 
armed  warrior  weigh  less  than  2.5  ounces.   The  
affected  creature  cannot  make  an  effective  attack  
against any creature bigger than a house cat, but may  
be able to slip under doors or into cracks and has a  
90% chance of moving about undetected (both in terms 
of sound and vision).
Fire Resistance:  This potion grants the imbiber the  
power of the spell resist fire.
Flying:  This potion grants the power of the spell fly.
Gaseous  Form:  The  drinker  and  all  of  their  gear 
become  insubstantial,  misty,  and  translucent.   The  
drinker  thus  becomes  immune  to  non-magical  
weapons, and has an Armor Class of 22 vs. magical  
weapons.  The imbiber can’t attack or cast spells while  
in gaseous form.  The drinker also loses supernatural  
abilities while in gaseous form.  A gaseous creature can  
fly at a speed of 10', and can pass through small holes  
or narrow openings, even mere cracks, as long as the  
potion persists.  The gaseous creature is subject to the  
effects of wind, and can’t enter water or other liquid.  
Objects cannot be manipulated in this form, even those  
brought  along  when  the  potion  was  imbibed.   The 
drinker cannot resume material form at will, but must  
wait for the potion to expire; however, the potion may  
171

TREASURE BASIC FANTASY RPG
be  quaffed  in  thirds,  in  which  case  each  drink  lasts 
1d4+1 turns.
Giant Strength:  This potion grants the imbiber the  
Strength of a giant.  For the duration, the drinker gains  
a bonus of +5 on attack and damage rolls with melee or 
thrown weapons, and can throw large stones just as a  
stone giant can.
Growth:  The drinker of this potion (with all equipment  
worn or carried) becomes twice normal height and eight 
times normal weight.  The enlarged character is treated  
as having the Strength of a Stone Giant (but without  
the  rock-throwing  ability),  gaining  +5  on  attack  and 
damage rolls.
Healing:  The imbiber of this potion receives 1d6+1 hit  
points of healing (as the spell cure light wounds).
Heroism:   This potion improves the fighting ability of  
the drinker.  Fighters of the 3rd level or less gain +3 to  
attack bonus as well as gaining 3 hit dice.  Fighters of  
4th or 5th level gain +2 to attack bonus and 2 hit dice.  
Fighters of 6th or 7th level gain +1 to attack bonus and  
1 hit die.  Fighters of 8th level or higher, as well as non-
Fighter class characters, receive +1 to attack bonus but  
gain no hit dice.  Hit dice gained are only temporary,  
and damage received is deducted from those hit dice  
first;  any  such  points  that  remain  when  the  potion 
expires are simply lost.
Invisibility:  This potion makes the imbiber invisible (as 
the spell).  This potion may be quaffed in thirds, in  
which case each drink lasts 1d4+1 turns.
Invulnerability:  This potion grants a bonus of +2 to  
Armor Class.
Levitation:  This potion grants the power of the spell  
levitate.
Longevity:   The  drinker  of  this  potion  becomes  
younger by 1d10 years.
Mind Reading:   This potion grants the power of the  
spell of the same name.
Poison:  This isn't a potion at all, it's a trap.  The drinker 
must save vs. Poison or die, even if only a sip was  
imbibed.
Polymorph Self:  This potion grants the power of the  
spell of the same name.
Speed:  This potion gives the drinker the benefits of the  
spell haste.
Treasure  Finding:   The  imbiber  of  this  potion  will 
immediately  know  the  direction  and  approximate  
distance to the largest treasure hoard in a 300' spherical  
radius.  This potion specifically detects platinum, gold,  
electrum,  silver,  and  copper;  gemstones  and  magic 
items are not detected.
Scrolls
Most  scrolls  contain  some  sort  of  magic  which  is 
activated  when  read,  and  which  may  only  be  used 
once; the characters burn away as the words are read.  
Spell Scrolls are enchanted with one or more Cleric or  
Magic-User spells (never both sorts on the same scroll).  
Each spell can be used just once, though of course the  
same spell may appear multiple times on a single scroll.  
Use the table below to determine the spell level of each  
spell on a scroll.  Only a Cleric can use a Clerical scroll,  
and only a Magic-User can use a Magic-User scroll.
Magic-Users  must  cast  read magic  on  a  spell  scroll 
before  being able  to use  it;  each scroll  needs to be  
treated  in  this  way  just  once,  and  the  effect  lasts 
indefinitely thereafter.  If a Magic-User attempts to cast  
a spell from a scroll, and they do not know that spell,  
there is a 10% chance the spell will fail.  If a spell on a  
scroll is of higher level than the highest level spell the  
Magic-User can cast, for each spell level of difference,  
add 10% to the chance of failure.  For example, Aura  
the 3 rd level Magic-User attempts to cast  polymorph 
self from a scroll.  Aura is able to cast, at most, 2 nd level 
spells.  Polymorph self is a 4th level spell, so Aura has a 
chance of failure of 10% (she doesn't know the spell)  
plus 20% (2 nd level maximum vs. 4 th level spell), for a  
total of 30%.
Clerical scrolls are written in a normal language (being  
just specially enchanted prayers), so the Cleric merely  
needs  to  know  the  language  in  which  the  scroll  is 
written in order to use it.  Clerics have the same chance  
of failure as do Magic-Users, save that the 10% penalty  
assigned for not knowing the spell does not apply.

A  Cursed  Scroll inflicts  some  curse  upon  whoever 
reads it.  It need not be read completely; in fact, merely  
glancing at the text is enough to inflict the curse.  A  
saving  throw  may  or  may  not  be  allowed,  as  
determined by the GM (though a save vs. Spells should  
usually  be  allowed).   The  GM  is  encouraged  to  be 
172

BASIC FANTASY RPG TREASURE
creative when creating curses; the spell  bestow curse  
(the  reverse  of  remove  curse)  can  be  used  for  
inspiration,  but  cursed  scrolls  can  contain  more  
powerful or inventive curses at the GM's discretion.
Protection Scrolls can be read by any character class,  
assuming the character can read the language the scroll  
is written in (see the notes under Language on page 4 
of the  Character section for details).  When read, a  
protection scroll creates a 10' radius protective circle  
around  the  reader;  preventing  the  warded  creatures 
from entering.  The circle moves with the reader.  Any  
creature other than the sort the scroll wards may enter,  
including of course the allies of the scroll-reader, who  
are  themselves  protected  so  long  as  they  remain  
entirely  within  the  circle.   If  any  creature  within the 
circle  performs  a  melee  attack  against  any  of  the 
warded creatures, the circle is broken and the warded  
creatures may freely attack.  Normal protection scrolls  
last for 2 turns after being read.
Protection  from  Magic scrolls  are  special,  as  they 
protect  against  magic  spells  and  items  rather  than 
creatures.  No magical effect can cross the 10' circle of  
protection in either direction for 1d4 turns.  As with the  
other protection scrolls, the circle created by this scroll  
moves with the reader.
Treasure Maps are generally non-magical.  They must  
be  created  by  the  GM,  although  they  may  delay 
creating the map until the characters can actually use it.  
The treasure on the map will normally be guarded by  
some sort of monster, as determined by the GM.
Wands, Staves and Rods
A wand is a short stick, generally 12 to 18 inches long,  
imbued with the power to cast a specific spell or spell-
like effect.  A newly created wand has 20 charges, and  
each use of the wand depletes one of those charges; a  
wand found in a treasure hoard will have 2d10 charges  
remaining.  If a wand generates an effect equivalent to  
a spell, assume the spell functions as if cast by a 6 th 
level caster, or the lowest level caster who could cast  
that spell (whichever is higher), unless otherwise noted.  
Wands  are  generally  usable  only  by  Magic-Users.  
Saving throws are rolled as normal, but on the Magic  
Wands column rather than the Spells column.
A staff has a number of different (but often related)  
spell effects.  A newly created staff has 30 charges, and  
each use of the staff depletes one or more of those  
charges.  A staff found in a treasure hoard will have  
3d10 charges remaining.  Spell effects generated by a  
staff operate at 8 th level, or the lowest caster level the  
spell  could  be  cast  by,  whichever  is  higher,  unless 
otherwise  stated.   Staves are  usable  only  by  Magic-
Users,  except  where  noted.   Saving  throws  against 
magic from a staff are rolled on the Spells column.
A rod is a scepter-like item with a special power unlike  
that of any known spell.  Rods are normally usable by  
any class.
Rod  of  Cancellation:   This  rod  may  only  be  
successfully used once.  If struck against another magic  
item,  it  utterly  destroys  all  enchantments  within  the 
item;  this  expends  the  rod's  magic.   A  roll  to hit  is 
required if the target item is held by another character  
or creature.
Snake Staff:   This item is a walking staff +1.  When  
used by a Cleric, the user may command the staff to  
transform into a constrictor snake (instead of causing  
damage)  on  a  successful  hit.   The  snake  will  wrap 
around a target up to man sized and hold them fast for  
1d4 turns, unless a save vs. Spells is made.  The snake  
does  not  attack  in  any  other  way,  nor  cause  any 
damage.  The snake may be recalled by the user at any  
point, in which case it returns to their hand and returns  
to staff  form.   It  also  returns  in  this way  when  the 
duration expires, or if the save is made.  The snake has  
Armor Class 15, moves 20' per round and has 20 hit  
points;  any  hit  points  of  damage  taken  are  healed 
completely when the snake returns to staff form; if killed 
in snake form, the magic is destroyed and it turns into a  
broken stick.  The staff may be used any number of  
times per day, and neither has nor uses charges.

TREASURE BASIC FANTASY RPG
Staff  of  Commanding:   This  staff  can  cast  charm 
person and  charm monster  spells, and can grant a  
power equivalent to a Potion of Plant Control .  Each  
function uses one charge.
Staff of Healing:  This staff can heal 1d6+1 hit points  
per charge expended, as the spell cure light wounds . 
Alternately,  with  an expenditure  of  two charges,  the 
staff can cast cure disease.  This staff is only usable by  
a Cleric.
Staff of Power:   This staff has the following powers  
costing  one  charge  per  use:   lightning  bolt  (6d6 
damage), fireball (6d6 damage), cone of cold  (as the  
wand,  for  6d6  damage),  continual  light,  and  
telekinesis (as the ring, lasting at most 1d6 turns).  T he 
staff  is  also  a  Walking  Staff +2,  and  can  be  used 
exactly as a Staff of Striking.  A staff of power can be  
used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken  
by its wielder.  All charges currently in the staff are  
instantly released in a 30' radius, doing 1d6 points of  
damage per charge remaining (save vs. Spells for half  
damage).  All within the area, including the wielder, are  
affected by this.  Even after all charges have been used,  
it remains a walking staff +2.
Staff of Striking:  This staff has no attack bonus, but is  
treated as a +1 weapon with respect to what sorts of  
monsters it can hit (and is usable by any class in that  
mode).  This staff's primary power may only be used if  
wielded by a Cleric:  By uttering a command word, the  
Cleric may create an effect similar to the spell striking. 
Expenditure of one charge adds 1d6 points of damage  
to the weapon's next strike; expenditure of two charges  
adds 2d6, and expenditure of three charges adds 3d6  
damage.  If the weapon is not successfully used after  
the  command  word  has  been  spoken,  the  effect  
dissipates after one turn.
Staff of Wizardry:  This staff is equivalent to the  Staff 
of Power, above, and has the following powers as well:  
invisibility,  passwall,  web,  and  conjure  elementals 
(as the spell, but conjuring staff elementals as described  
in the Monsters section).  These powers each use one  
charge when activated.
Wand of Cold:  This wand generates a conical blast of  
cold doing 6d8 damage (save vs. Magic Wands for half  
damage).  The cone spreads from the tip of the wand to 
a width of 30' at a distance of 40' away.
Wand of Enemy Detection:   The effect of this wand is  
to make all enemies of the user within 60' glow with a  
greenish white light for one round.  Even hidden or  
invisible enemies glow  in this way, revealing them, but  
enemies completely out of sight (such as behind a wall)  
may  not  be  seen by  the  user.   An  "enemy"  is any 
creature which is thinking of or otherwise intending to  
harm the user; also, all undead monsters and animated  
constructs within range will glow in this way regardless  
of intent or thoughts (or lack thereof).
Wand of Fear:  This wand generates the effect of the  
spell cause fear (the reverse of the spell remove fear).
Wand  of  Fireballs:   This  wand  generates  fireballs, 
exactly as the spell, doing 6d6 damage.
Wand of Illusion:  This wand allows the user to create  
illusions equivalent to the spell phantasmal force.
Wand  of  Lightning  Bolts:   This  wand  generates  
lightning bolts, exactly as the spell, doing 6d6 damage.
Wand of Magic Detection: This wand grants the user a 
power equivalent to the spell detect magic.
Wand of Paralysis:  This wand creates the effect of the  
spell hold person.
Wand of Polymorph:  This wand can be used to cast  
either polymorph self or polymorph other.
Wand of Secret Door Detection:   This wand grants  
the user a power similar to the spell  find traps , but  
which reveals secret doors rather than traps.
Wand of Trap Detection:  This wand grants the user a  
power equivalent to the spell find traps.
Miscellaneous Items
These items may take any of several forms, and have a  
variety of effects; when randomly rolled, the effect is  
determined first (as explained with the tables above)  
and  then  the  form  is  rolled  on  a  separate  table. 
Generally,  such  an  item  is  written  as  a  [Form]  of 
[Effect], for example, a Cloak of Fire Resistance.
Items with forms meant to be worn are limited in that  
only a normal number may be used at one time: at  
most two rings (one on each hand), one cloak, a pair of  
boots, one helm, and one pendant.  If a character is  
wearing  two  items  that  grant  the  same  continuous 
effect,  such  as  Cold Resistance  or  Protection, only  
one such item will function.  If the items have differing  
levels of effect, such as a Cloak of Protection +1 and a 
Ring of Protection +3 , only the more powerful item  
will operate (in this case, the ring).
While the tables on page  168 provide standard forms  
for miscellaneous items, the Game Master is in no way  
limited to what  appears on  the  Form  of  Item  table; 
items may be created with forms not normally allowed  
there, or indeed even in forms that are not there at all.

Miscellaneous Item Effects
Blasting:  When this device is played (as appropriate  
for its form), it creates a powerful blast of sound filling a  
cone 10’ long and 2’ wide at the base.  Those within  
the area of effect suffer 2d6 points of damage and are  
deafened for 1 full turn.  A successful saving throw vs.  
Death Ray reduces damage by half and reduces the  
period of deafness to a single round.
The  device  can also be  used to damage  or destroy  
buildings, fortifications, etc.  Double the damage listed  
above when this item is used against a structure.  The  
Stronghold rules in the Game Master section contains 
further guidance on this.
Blending:   The  wearer of  this item  becomes nearly  
invisible, granting an 80% chance that the wearer can  
move about unnoticed.  If detected by onlookers, the  
wearer can be attacked without significant penalty.
Cold Resistance:   The wearer of this device receives  
protection as the spell  resist cold , but the protection  
works continually.
Comprehension:  The wearer of this device is granted  
the ability to read any language, including any form of  
magical  script.   Being  able  to  read  magic  does  not 
confer magical abilities upon the wearer, but if worn by  
a  magic-user  it  grants  the  effects  of  read  magic 
constantly.  Note that when reading non-magical texts,  
the  limitations  described  under  the  spell  read 
languages apply to this device also.
Control Animal:  The wearer of this device can charm  
up to 6 hit dice of animals.  The effect works much like  
a  charm  person spell,  but  only  affects animals  
(including  giant-sized  animals,  but  excluding  fantastic 
creatures as well as anything more intelligent than a dog 
or cat).   The wearer can activate the  power at  will,  
targeting any animal within 60' that they can see.  The  
wearer may choose to end the effect for one or more  
controlled  creatures  at  any  time,  in  order  to  "free" 
enough hit dice to control a new target.
Control Human:  The wearer of this device may cast  
the  spell  charm  person at  any  target  they  can  see 
within 60'.    The wearer can use this power once per  
round, at will.  If more than one humanoid is to be  
affected, the wearer cannot control more than 6 hit dice 
or levels of humanoids at a time; however, the wearer  
may  choose  to  end  the  effect  for  one  or  more  
controlled  creatures  at  any  time,  in  order  to  "free" 
enough hit dice or levels to control a new target.
Control Plant:  The wearer of this device may create  
an effect equivalent to a  Potion of Plant Control  at  
will, affecting plants or plant creatures within 60' that  
they can see.  The effect lasts as long as the wearer  
remains within 60' of the plants or plant creatures.  A  
saving throw is allowed just as for the potion.
Courage:  When this device is played, all characters  
and creatures friendly to the user within 60 feet are  
affected as by the spell remove fear.
Deception:  This device grants to the wearer the power  
of  the  Deceiver  (as  described  on  page  75).   Any  
attacker will believe the wearer is 3 feet from their true  
location, and the attacker's first strike will always miss.  
Thereafter, the attacker suffers a penalty of -2 on all  
attack  rolls.   This  device  does  not  affect  mindless 
creatures, constructs such as golems or living statues, or  
any sort of undead.  Living creatures which are not  
mindless will be affected even if they do not use sight to  
target the wearer.
Delusion:  Whoever  wears  this  device  believes  it  is 
some other form of useful magical device, and behaves  
thus (so for example, if Darion believes he is wearing a  
Ring of Invisibility he will believe himself to actually be 
invisible).  Unlike the potion of the same name, the  
device's effect is not dispelled by the wearer suffering  
damage; in fact, the only way to rid a character of this  
cursed item is with the spell remove curse.
Djinni Summoning:   Each device of this type has a  
specific djinni bound to it, which will be summoned to  
the wearer's location when they rub the device while  
wearing it.  The djinni appears in the next round and  
protects, serves, and obeys the wearer.  The djinni will  
serve at most 1 hour per day, and can be summoned at 
most once per day.  If the djinni bound to a device is  
ever slain, the ring loses all magical properties.

TREASURE BASIC FANTASY RPG
Doom:  When this device is played (as appropriate for  
its form), this device will create animated skeletons or  
zombies as if by the spell animate dead.  Up to 3d6 hit 
dice  of  undead  monsters  will  be  so  created  from 
remains  within  a  60'  radius  of  the  character  who 
activated the device.  If both skeletal and fleshy remains  
are  available  in  the  area  of  effect,  skeletons  will  be 
animated in preference over zombies.  If the user is a  
magic-user  or  cleric,  the  created  undead  may  be  
controlled so long as that character retains the device.  
If played by a fighter or thief, the undead created will  
be  uncontrolled,  and  will  attack  any  living  creatures 
nearby.  The device may be used once per day, but no  
more than 18 hit dice of undead created by it may exist  
at any one time.
Fire Resistance:   The wearer of this device receives  
protection as the spell  resist fire , but  the protection  
works continually.
Invisibility:  The  wearer  of  this device  can  become 
invisible (as the spell invisibility) on command.  If the  
invisibility is dispelled (as described for the spell), the  
device may not be reactivated for one full turn.  The  
invisibility effect otherwise lasts for 24 hours.
Levitation:  The wearer of this device may levitate (as 
the spell) at will by concentrating.  There is no limit to  
how long this device may be used.
Mind Reading:  Whoever wears this device has access  
to a permanent form of the spell  mind reading ; it is  
always available  but  only  activates when the  wearer 
spends a full round concentrating upon it, and persists  
until the wearer ceases to use it.  The effect can be  
activated as many times per day as the wearer wants.
Panic:  When this device is played (as appropriate for  
its form), all creatures more than 20 feet from the user  
but not over 120 feet away must save vs. Spells or be  
affected as by the spell cause fear.
Penetrating Vision:   On command, and for so long  
thereafter that the wearer concentrates on it, this device  
confers the power to see through solid matter as if it  
were transparent as glass.  The effect extends at most  
20 feet, and the wearer sees as if in normal light even if  
they are in fact in total darkness.
This effect is blocked by certain materials; the wearer  
can see through at most 3 feet of wood or soil, 1 foot of 
stone, or 1 inch of most metals.  Gold or lead no thicker 
than foil will completely block the effect.
The device may be used three times per day, and each  
use lasts at most one turn.
Protection:  The wearer of an item with this power  
receives  the  listed  benefit  (from  +1  to  +3)  to  their 
Armor Class for so long as the ring is worn.  This bonus 
is also applied to the wearer's saving throw die rolls.
Protection from Energy Drain:   This device  has the  
power to absorb and neutralize energy-draining attacks,  
death spells or effects (such as slay living), and curses  
that would otherwise affect the wearer.  The device has  
2d6  charges  when  found,  and  each  negative  level, 
curse, or spell absorbed consumes one charge .  When  
the device's charges are exhausted it disintegrates into  
golden sparkles and disappears.
Protection from Scrying:   The wearer of this item is  
immune to all forms of scrying (including crystal balls,  
clairvoyance,  clairaudience,  and any  other means  of 
location or spying at a distance) as well as any form of  
mind reading.  Other characters who are within 30' of  
the wearer are also immune to scrying, but not to mind 
reading.
Regeneration:  This  device  grants  the  wearer  the  
power  of  regeneration,  exactly  as  described  in  the 
description  of  the  Troll  on  page  152,  including  the 
weakness with respect to acid and fire damage.  Note  
that this device will only heal damage suffered while it is 
worn; pre-existing damage is not healed by putting on  
the device.
Scrying:  This device can be used to spy upon other  
people or locations, regardless of distance.  A scrying  
device  may only be used by Magic-Users.  It can be  
used three times per day, for up to a turn each time.
The chance of success when using a scrying device is as 
shown below.  Total chances equal to or greater than  
100% do not require a roll.
Knowledge and Connection Chance
Secondhand Knowledge (heard of) 25%
Firsthand Knowledge (seen briefly) 55%
Familiar (known well) 95%
Possession or garment +25%
Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc. +50%
The user of the device is the only one who will see the  
image.   No  sound  will  be  heard  normally.   Detect 
magic,  detect  evil,  and  mind  reading have  a  3% 
chance per level of the caster of operating correctly if  
used with a scrying device.
Scrying,  Superior:  This  item  works  exactly  like  a 
standard scrying device, as described above, but also  
allows  the  user  to  hear  any  sounds  in  the  location 
viewed as if they were there.
